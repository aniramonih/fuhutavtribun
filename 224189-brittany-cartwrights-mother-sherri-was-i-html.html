The relationship between the two women is close, and Sherry is a loving mom-in-law to Brittany's husband Jax too.</p><p class=dh>As it turned out, Sherry spent several days in the hospital after her March 30 procedure and was sent home to recover. But <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=http://people.com/tv/vanderpump-rules-brittany-cartwright-mom-out-of-icu-pastor/>instead of improving, her health declined</a>. Instead of catching that scheduled flight to L.A., Sherry ended up making a trip to the ER where doctors made a horrifying discovery.</p><p class=dh>The surgeons who had operated on <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=http://www.bravotv.com/the-daily-dish/brittany-cartwright-mom-sherri-cartwright-bladder-surgery>Sherry had torn her bowl</a> during the original bladder surgery. The torn bowl had been leaking its contents into her body, causing sepsis that could have cost her her life.</p><p class=dh><strong class=bh>HOSPITALIZED DURING COVID-19</strong></p><p class=dh>Brittany flew to Kentucky to be by Sherry's side throughout her ordeal, and Jax joined her within a few days. Brittany's anguish at seeing her normally energetic mother on life support was compounded by the difficulties the current COVID-19 restrictions placed on visitors to the ICU.</p><p class=dh>Thankfully, Sherry rallied, and her health slowly started improving. One of the people who were there, supporting the family through their ordeal was their pastor, Ryan Dotson. Dotson called for prayers for Sherry's recovery on social media, <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.facebook.com/ryan.dotson.144/posts/3316804685010016>writing</a>:</p><p class=dh>“Please pray for my friend and church member Sherri Turner Cartwright. She had to have an emergency surgery (...) She’s in ICU and things are uncertain, so please join us in prayer."</p><p class=dh>Dotson had been the pastor Brittany and Jax initially had wanted to officiate at their wedding. The couple ended up being joined in matrimony by another pastor in June 2019, after some transphobic and homophobic remarks Dotson had made in the past became public.</p><p class=dh><strong class=bh>CONTROVERSY</strong></p><p class=dh>"Vanderpump Rules" has been plagued by controversy, which came close to affecting Brittany and Jax. Castmembers Stassi Schroeder, Kristen Doute, Max Boyens, and Brett Caprioni were fired by Bravo in June 2020 after racist remarks they'd made in the past surfaced.</p><p class=dh>Boyens, Caprioni were recent additions to the cast, but Schroeder and Doute had been with the show since it began in 2013. The ostensibly politically correct Schroeder made several racist comments on her podcast and was discovered to have staged an ugly stunt involving African American castmate Faith Stowers.</p><p class=dh>Schroeder and Doute conspired to give false information to the police in an attempt to have Stowers whom they disliked arrested. They identified Stowers to the police as the woman who had been drugging and robbing men in the L.A. area.</p><p class=dh>Another Bravo star, "Real Housewives of Atlanta" star Porsha Williams, who is the granddaughter of deceased Martin Luther King Jr's right-hand man and fellow activist Hosea Williams, <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-8408293/Stassi-Schroeder-pal-Rachael-OBrien-says-begged-not-post-Nazi-chic-selfie.html>called attention to another disturbing sign.</a></p><p class=dh>Schroeder had posted a selfie of herself with two friends on Instagram in 2018, in which she was dressed in black, wearing a black cap, and a handbag with an "SS" logo, and<a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-8408293/Stassi-Schroeder-pal-Rachael-OBrien-says-begged-not-post-Nazi-chic-selfie.html> captioned it as "Nazi chic."</a></p><p class=dh>Jax, who had made some homophobic comments in the past, was not fired. Jax and Brittany had met in Las Vegas in 2015, and it was love at first sight.
