bunch in a recent media update where his mom and his kids enjoyed fun moments during a family vacation.</p><p class=dh>Basketball star LeBron James' mom, Gloria James, gave fans a look through how she and her family members were having fun-filled adventures during vacation.</p><p class=dh>The group looked radiant in several snapshots that Gloria shared on her Instagram page. The first photo had her flaunting her ageless looks and a big hearty smile. The matriarch and her grandchildren held an uncanny resemblance.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.amomama.com/bb4bb987e5d1c94b9d17fc277a96cb5a.jpg><p class=zj data-testid=image-source>LeBron James pictured at Madison Square Garden in New York City on April 9, 2018. | Photo: Getty Images</p><p class=dh>Gloria let fans know she was experiencing love to the fullest with her beloved grandkids. As the family posed for the camera, LeBron’s oldest kids towered above their grandma.</p><p class=dh>The group was photographed posing for the camera as they took laps through the pool. The youthful matriarch shared more photo slides of her beautiful family indulging in the various activities at their location. Gloria sweetly wrote in <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.instagram.com/p/CQ6kct9MgYC/>her caption</a>:</p><p class=dh>"Family. They teach me the meaning of love every day. I'm so blessed to be part of this cycle of life…"</p><p class=dh><strong class=bh>THE JAMES' FAMILY VALUE</strong></p><p class=dh>Just as Gloria displayed in her post that family was the most important unit in the journey through life, her son has also exhibited the same values. Last year in October, LeBron showed that family stood as the highest priority.</p><p class=dh>Just after his victory over the Miami Heat and acing his fourth NBA championship win, LeBron opted out of celebrations with his teammates for a while. He got on <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/nba/2020/10/12/lebron-james-calls-mom-gloria-after-title/5965300002/>a call</a> with his mom and quickly turned emotional.</p><p class=dh>The star was filmed lying on the floor of his locker room, gushing over the matriarch and thanking him for his influence in his life and his thriving career. LeBron told his mom that he achieved all he had because of her.</p><p class=dh>He recalled her struggles as a teenage mom who got pregnant at 16. He praised her strength, and all the while, Gloria congratulated her son as she let him know that God was great.</p><p class=dh><strong class=bh>LEBRON AS A SON</strong></p><p class=dh>It is safe to say that LeBron James has gone far and wide, and he has become a global star. Through it all, he has kept his mother close to his heart. Because of this, he never strays far away from her.</p><p class=dh>However, the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.si.com/nba/lakers/news/lebron-james-says-the-hardest-part-of-quarantine-was-not-seeing-his-mother>was challenging</a> because the basketball pro was unable to see his mom for more than three months. He noted that he missed his mom so much, and seeing her again evoked deep emotions from him.</p><p class=dh><strong class=bh>A PROUD FATHER</strong></p><p class=dh>Just as LeBron keeps making his mom proud with each of his achievements and milestones, it is safe to say his kids are on that path as well. In May, his second son, Bryce, <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://people.com/parents/lebron-james-celebrates-son-bryce-middle-school-graduation/>completed his</a> middle school education.</p><p class=dh>LeBron did not hold back his proud dad moment as he took to Instagram sharing a <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label="https://www.instagram.com/p/CPbdc3Ihnko/?utm_medium=copy_link">lovely photo</a> of Bryce with his wife, Savannah James, posing for the camera and looking cheerful.</p><p class=dh>The A-list sports star praised his son and addressed him on how proud he was. Lebron encouraged his growing son to keep reaching for the top. Star mom Savannah also showed her pride smiling near her son and raising a peace sign.</p><p class=dh>Bryce is the middle child among the three kids that Savannah and LeBron have together. The oldest is Bronny, and the youngest is the pretty Zhuri Nova.</p><p class=dh><strong class=bh>KEEPING UP THE VALUES</strong></p><p class=dh>Once speaking with Maverick Carter about his family and his relations with his kids, <a class="me a" href=#>LeBron</a> shared that he thinks of how his childhood was a far cry from how they currently live.</p><p class=dh>The world champion noted that his kids would <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.cnbc.com/2019/03/12/how-lebron-james-teaches-his-kids-about-money.html>never understand</a> what it was like being at "the bottom," and to him, this posed a challenge that he had to deal with.</p><p class=dh>Despite the disparity between his upbringing and that of his kids, the star noted that he tries to keep them grounded. He does this by making them realize that they have to appreciate what they have.</p><p class=dh>The basketball icon added that he makes sure his kids do not take money for granted. LeBron shared that he did not want them to have a feeling that money could always be accessible to them.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmimlazAb63MqKSapZFjsLC5jmttcG9hanqtscGrpqdlmpa6pr%2BMbGSkoZSoerS0zrBkrqaTlruvxYyrnKydnZe5b7TTpqM%3D</p></div><div id=links><a href=./baby-names.html>&#171;&nbsp;Lianna: Name Meaning and Origin</a>
