Summer and Bruce continued writing songs together after the band's disbandment in 1980 and later married that year.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.amomama.com/9c44f20192a63a0acecdc7992deb8ae6.jpg><p class=zj data-testid=image-source>Donna Summer and Bruce Sudano. | Photo: Getty Images</p><p class=dh>After their marriage, Bruce became the stepfather of Mimi, Summer's daughter from her first marriage. The couple welcomed two daughters, Brooklyn and Amanda Grace, in 1981 and 1982, respectively.</p><p class=dh>On May 17, 2012, Summer died from lung cancer, leaving behind her husband, kids, and an evergreen legacy. Summer's lastborn daughter, Amanda, took after her and Bruce by going into music.</p><p class=dh>However, that is not where it stops. Like her parents, Amanda's husband, Abner Ramirez, is also a musician, and together, they make up the band Johnnyswim.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.amomama.com/9cafe2e15dea8fb1f73f9730102d9dfc.jpg><p class=zj data-testid=image-source>Portrait of US Singer Donna Summer 1976. | Photo: Getty Images</p><p class=dh>During an <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.mother.ly/podcast/Season-4/amanda-sudano-ramirez-on-embracing-adventure-and-chaos>appearance</a> on the "Motherly" podcast, Amanda opened up on how she met her husband. She revealed they both went to college in Nashville.</p><p class=dh>She saw Ramirez across a crowded room and thought then that he could be her brother because she saw him from afar and felt they had the same skin color.</p><h3 class=ih><strong class=bh>Amanda and Ramirez ensure they are always there for their kids.</strong></h3><p class=dh>When he turned around and started walking, she felt he was super cute. However, Ramirez was with all the popular girls, and Amanda was the nerdy and introspective type. Hence, she avoided him at all costs.</p><p class=dh>After college, Amanda moved to New York. When she returned to Nashville and met Ramirez at a coffee shop with a close friend, he spoke to her, and she felt he was charming.</p><p class=dh>At first, she wanted to hook him up with some of her friends as she was already in a relationship. However, they started chatting on MySpace, after which he invited her to a show he was playing in.</p><p class=dh>She went to the show and ended up breaking up with her boyfriend. She was blown away by his singing and started having feelings for him.</p><p class=dh>After the show, she asked him to write songs with her and for her among several questions. Amanda and Ramirez started writing songs together and started making out a year later.</p><p class=dh>They married in 2009 and are now parents to three children, son Joaquin, born in 2015, and daughters Luna, born in 2018, and Paloma, born in 2019.</p><p class=dh>Amanda regularly updates her Instagram page with pictures of her family's numerous beautiful moments. For example, in February 2020, she shared a blurry image showing her and Ramirez performing during a concert.</p><p class=dh>In the post's caption, she expressed how life is for her and Ramirez as musicians who are constantly on tour and parents to three children. She <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.instagram.com/p/B9F6ICDFmGW/>wrote</a>:</p><p class=dh>"This depicts how life with three kids on the road feels pretty well actually."</p><p class=dh>Despite the challenges of blending parenting with their musical career, Amanda and Ramirez ensure they are always there for their kids and share beautiful experiences with them.</p><p class=dh>Last month she shared a picture showing her and her three children during a trip to Paris. In the snapshot, the proud mom and her kids were at the Eiffel Tower.</p><h3 class=ih><strong class=bh>Amanda revealed she started writing and recording songs as a child thanks to her dad</strong></h3><p class=dh>The first picture showed Amanda cuddling Paloma, while the second snap showed her trying to attend to all of her children at once. In the post's caption, she <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.instagram.com/p/CSNUbgiDaBS/>wrote</a>:</p><p class=dh>"This first pic is of my daughter having a tantrum in Paris. Normally she has them at home, but this week we're lucky enough to experience them someplace magical and gorgeous..."</p><p class=dh>Amanda described the second picture as a Renaissance painting called "Everyone Wants Mom at the Same Time." She advised her followers to travel with their kids if they can.</p><p class=dh>The musician added that traveling with her kids may be horrible sometimes, but she believes doing so with them now means they will still want to travel with her when they are older.</p><p class=dh>In July, Amanda shared a picture of her and Ramirez <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.instagram.com/p/CRrphZULIck/>posing</a> with their three kids and a video showing Joaquin trying to lay his bed while his dad watched.</p><p class=dh>Besides parenting their kids, there is nothing Amanda and Ramirez love more than playing music together. She usually shares pictures of their numerous performances on social media.</p><p class=dh>In July 2020, she shared <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.instagram.com/p/CCy3hublzuJ/>pictures</a> from their first musical performance amid the pandemic and thanked those who attended and made it possible.</p><p class=dh>In May, Amanda shared photos from <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.instagram.com/p/COWPEZiL-S6/>the making</a> of her and Ramirez's "Best Thing Ever" video. One of the snaps showed her in a white dress while her husband played the guitar beside her.</p><p class=dh>Amanda and Ramirez are close friends with home improvement couple Chip and Joanna Gaines. In October 2019, Chip and Joanna announced that Ramirez and Amanda would star in Magnolia Network's first series, "Home on the Road."</p><p class=dh>The series follows the couple as they tour North America with their kids. In a chat with People, Ramirez and Amanda <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://people.com/home/how-chip-and-joanna-gaines-asked-their-best-friends-to-star-in-the-first-show-for-magnolia-network/>opened up</a> about their experience filming the series and revealed it was one of the hardest things they had ever done.</p><p class=dh>However, they said they would not trade the experience for anything because they were lucky enough to have Chip and Joanna tell their story.</p><p class=dh>With a beautiful family and an extraordinary musical career with her husband, Amanda has not only taken after her parents but is keeping their legacy alive. Of course, she would never have achieved that without their tutelage.</p><p class=dh>In a chat with CBS Philly, she <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://philadelphia.cbslocal.com/2016/11/16/interview-johnnyswim-and-the-shadow-of-summer/>opened up</a> about how she was compared to her mom. Hence, people wanted to make her into the new version of who Summer was or what she could be now.</p><p class=dh>She said one of the things she loved so much about Ramirez was that they were both over people telling them what they thought they should be.</p><p class=dh>Amanda added that her mom, <a class="me a" href=#>Summer</a>, always encouraged her and Ramirez to find their own voice and not to rush it but enjoy writing music and figuring it out themselves.</p><p class=dh>In an interview with Glide Magazine, Amanda <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://glidemagazine.com/121042/amanda-sudano-abner-ramirez-johnnyswim-interview/>revealed</a> she started writing and recording songs as a child thanks to her dad, who had a studio at home and allowed his kids into it after school.</p><p class=dh>Those little steps have blossomed into a beautiful career for Amanda, and with a loving and talented husband like Ramirez and their beautiful kids, there is undoubtedly more to come.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmimlazAb63MqKSapZFjsLC5jmtucWlkaXqlu82nmGarpaK6pr6Mm6mum5ViwLawwKemrGWUlsKotNOeqWaen6G5b7TTpqM%3D</p></div><div id=links><a href=./drew-barrymore-sparks-reaction-prom-dress-new-tiktok-video.html>&#171;&nbsp;Drew Barrymore makes the most amazing career callback in a prom dress</a>
