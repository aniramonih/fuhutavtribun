When I was young, we took a family trip to Arizona. I'm not sure, but I think he was Havasupai. We messed around one night, then I went to our camp site and filled a flash light with beans to take back to him. Just as things were about to heat up again, Dad showed up.</p><p>Funny, Dad disappeared later that night and Mom spent hours calling after him....</p><table class="info small"><tr><td class=by>by <span>Anonymous</span></td><td class=count>reply 61</td><td class=timestamp><span>October 24, 2021 2:56 AM</span></td></tr></table><p>I go for exotic types, particularly when they're half naked.</p><p>You tell him...I'll make up for all the indignities they suffered in ROOTS.</p><table class="info small"><tr><td class=by>by <span>Anonymous</span></td><td class=count>reply 62</td><td class=timestamp><span>October 24, 2021 6:15 AM</span></td></tr></table><p>A couple - some were mixed white/Native, others were pure. One bottom, very small, whose hair was up when I picked him up, but when we got in bed, he let it down and it was all the way down his back - a little freaky for me. Someone above erred in not recognizing that most Mexicans are mixed race, with the majority of the mixture being Native. They have as much right to call themselves Native American as anyone born in the United states. If I were to count Mexicans, I'd have to up my count to about 20.</p><table class="info small"><tr><td class=by>by <span>Anonymous</span></td><td class=count>reply 63</td><td class=timestamp><span>October 24, 2021 9:45 AM</span></td></tr></table><p>I could write a brief book about NAs. Definitely among the most peculiar experiences I've had.</p><p>First one was Inuk in Saskatchewan. He cried and started praying after we had sex. He had hypospodias.</p><p>A couple more in OK. Good experiences there overall.</p><p>A friend visited me from NYC and decided he had to have sex with a NA before he went home. He found one to hook up with in the bathroom of a gay bar. He was satisfied.</p><p>Then things took a turn for the awful. Repeated encounters with drunk and high NAs. Filthy as in days/weeks without bathing. Several into scat, and of course never said so until we were doing the deed. They would lie lie lie about their appearance, age, race, whatever. Huge lies not little ones. Like they were 50 and 320 lbs and NA, but would say they were 30 and 180 lbs and a blond white guy. Bizarre shit.</p><p>The last straws were a man who is the President (they don't call them Chief anymore I guess) of a local large tribe I fucked, and he lied to me about his identity and his race. Just stupid and annoying. And yes he was into scat.</p><p>Then the last last straw was a guy I talked to online, but he didn't show up when he said he would, so I disinvited him. Nevertheless he showed up many hours later, at 7am, got my apt# wrong, and was drunk and banging on my neighbor's door, demanding to be let in. I called the police.</p><p>No more NAs for me.</p><table class="info small" readability=1.5><tr readability=3><td class=by>by <span>Anonymous</span></td><td class=count>reply 65</td><td class=timestamp><span>October 24, 2021 10:18 PM</span></td></tr></table><p>R65 HOW do you get into situations like that?</p><p>Seriously, maybe you're attracting the wrong type of guys.</p><p>Don't call me Shirley</p><a href=# rel=nofollow>Offsite Link</a><table class="info small"><tr><td class=by>by <span>Anonymous</span></td><td class=count>reply 66</td><td class=timestamp><span>October 26, 2021 9:27 PM</span></td></tr></table><p>I once drove through Santa Fe (or was it Taos?) and stopped to tour the ‚Äúoldest apartment complex in the US.‚Äù It‚Äôs like the projects for Indians and they sell stuff.

I was surprised when I ran my DNA a couple goodies popped out. To look at me you can tell I'm of Italian ancestry but have both Mohawk and Ashkenazi ancestors too.</p><p>The fun part I know How I ended up with Mohawk ancestry - definitely from mom's side of the family Mine were people who were here in the U.S. in the 16th century.
