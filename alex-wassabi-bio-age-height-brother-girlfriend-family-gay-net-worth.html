The ability of two or more people to work together seamlessly has given us many great things. In entertainment too, many collaborative efforts have yielded some of the best works of entertainment in human history. YouTube, which is one of the leading platforms for entertainment and creative works in general, features collaborations as a prominent part of the process for many popular YouTubers. This was the formula used by Alex Burriss and Roi Fabito to create one of the leading channels on YouTube, but like most collaborations, a time comes when it comes to an end, and for the duo that ran Wassabi Productions that day was January 2016, when the other half of the group, Roi Fabito decided to leave the channel and pursue other interests leaving Alex to stand alone and come to be known as Alex Wassabi.</p><p>Today, a group that started with six boys is left with just Alex Wassabi to run the channel.

They welcomed him to the world on the 28th of March, 1990 in Great Falls, Montana, but the family had to move from the state to Kentucky when he was 1-year-old. After two years in Kentucky, his family relocated again, this time to North Carolina where he would meet a Filipino boy in middle school and begin a friendship that would later change his life.</p><p>Middle school was significant in the life of Alex Wassabi. He was also diagnosed with ADHD, which resulted in him struggling in school. Despite his condition, he was still able to complete the cycle of formal education and graduate college.</p><p>By the time he was graduating college, Alex Wassabi was already on the road to being a YouTube Star. He had met Roi Fabito in middle school and the two had started making videos to be posted on YouTube. Their videos consisted of lip syncs, dance videos, and funny videos.</p><p>After college graduation, the two moved to Los Angeles as part of efforts to grow their YouTube channels. The move immediately had its reward as they made their most popular video till date, a parody of Call Me Maybe by Carly Rae Jepsen, while there. The video shot Alex and Roi to the top of the YouTube ladder, with the video having over 100 million views and gaining them millions of subscribers in the process.</p><p>Since then, Alex has been a part of a successful channel that has accumulated over 3 billion views and 11 million subscribers. The success of the channel has led to tours where Alex and his friend, Roi traveled around the country and other parts of the world meeting their fans, hosting shows and creating more content for the channel.</p><p>On Wassabi productions, Alex Wassabi played the character, Richard who is disliked by another invented character on the channel, Rolanda. Rolanda is played by Roi Fabito.</p><p>When Roi departed Wassabi, the creative burden of the channel rested on Alex. He has since risen up to the challenge by creating another channel, Cuckoo Squad, where he posts solo vlogs as a way of connecting with the fans and viewers of Wassabi productions. The channel, under his control also features his brothers, Andrew and Aaron Burriss who are YouTubers with the Lazyron Studios channel. He has also taken his stardom beyond YouTube by starring in films like The Duff, Escape the Night and Laid in America.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=net-worth></span><strong>Net Worth</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>As the current owner and manager of Wassabi Productions, with access to the channel’s ad revenue and other brand associations, Alex Wassabi has been able to build a net worth of $3 million.
