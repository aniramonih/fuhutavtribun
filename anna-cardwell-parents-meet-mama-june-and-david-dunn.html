But how well do you know them? Read on as we discuss details of who her parents, Mama June and David Dunn are.</p><h2><strong>Who is Anna Cardwell?</strong></h2><p>Anna Cardwell was a young girl known very well as a member of the Shannon family. Growing up was however some tough moments for her and while she was in her mother’s custody, she was sexually abused by her mother’s then-boyfriend, Mark McDaniel, who was later convicted for his crimes. Like her mother, Anna Cardwell became pregnant as a teenager and gave birth to her first child, daughter Kaitlyn Elizabeth, in 2012.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p>Kaitlyn has the surname Clark, after Anna Cardwell’s longtime boyfriend Caleb Clark, but Anna has never publicly named Kaitlyn’s father; she has only said that they have not spoken since Kaitlyn was two months old and that he was engaged with two children. She and Clark eventually broke up and Anna went on to marry Michael Cardwell (b. 1992).</p><p>The two wed on May 25, 2014, and moved to Alabama, where their daughter Kylee Madison was born in 2015. Anna Cardwell and Michael separated in 2017 and Anna returned to Georgia with her two children.</p><h2><strong>Who are Anna Cardwell’s parents?</strong></h2><p>Born as Anna Marie Chickadee Cardwell Shannon, she was born on August 28, 1994 as the eldest of her mother June Shannon’s four children. Anna Cardwell’s father is known as David Dunn.</p><p>Anna Cardwell’s mother Mama June was just a young girl of 15 years old by then when Anna was born. As a result, she initially considered placing Anna for adoption by her aunt and uncle, Janice and James Shannon, but the paperwork was never finalised and Anna ultimately ended up being raised by her maternal grandmother, Sandra.</p><p>Anna Cardwell’s mother was born in McIntyre, Georgia to Sandra Hundley and Marvin Shannon, who divorced when she was two. She has three siblings: Joanne “Doe Doe” Shannon, Joanie Shannon (now McDonald) and James Edward Shannon; and two half-sisters, Michelle Shannon and Nicole Shannon. Due to childhood cataracts that went untreated, June is legally blind.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-under_second_paragraph"></span><p>June became pregnant with her first daughter, Anna, at 14, with her ex-boyfriend David Dunn being the father, and gave birth just days after her 15th birthday. She dropped out of school when she became pregnant, but she later earned her GED. She pursued relationships with men who would later become convicted sex offenders; her daughters Jessica and Lauryn were fathered by Michael Anthony Ford (b. 1977), who was found guilty of trying to exploit oral sexfrom a minor female online; and she briefly dated Mark<br>McDaniel, who was convicted of abusing Anna and whom Lauryn believed to be her biological father for some time.</p><p>Her youngest daughter, Alana, was born in 2005, fathered by Mike Thompson, from whom June split in 2014. Alongside Lauryn, June came out as bisexual in 2015. She stated she had been intimate with women but had never been in a relationship with one.</p><h2><strong>Anna Cardwell Death, what happened to Anna Cardwell?</strong></h2><p>Anna Cardwell was diagnosed with stage 4 cancer. After four rounds of chemotherapy, she was diagnosed with terminal cancer. Sadly, Anna Cardwell died on December 9, 2023, at her mother’s home.</p><ul class=td-pulldown-filter-list></ul><a class="td-social-sharing-button td-social-handler td-social-expand-tabs" href=# data-block-uid=tdi_37 title=More><i class="td-icon-plus td-social-expand-tabs-icon"></i></a><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-mid_content"></span><span style=border-color:#0a0a0a;border-width:1px;width:100%></span><span style=border-color:#0a0a0a;border-width:1px;width:100%></span><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-longer_content"></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qLTBmqqeZpOkunCtzaeYZpuRp7G4sculZKmZopq7tb%2BMppyerF2irq6tjKOsp51dlrulecOaraKcXZnCr7qO</p></div><div id=links><a href=./blac-chyna-reveals-the-perfect-spot-for-all-your-laser-and-aesthetic-needs-281391.html>&#171;&nbsp;Blac Chyna Reveals The Perfect Spot For All Your Laser And Aesthetic Needs</a>
