He was 29 years old, and Gloria was just 15 years old. Despite being just 15, she told Bryce to be in her early twenties. Later, DNA test analysis revealed that Bryce’s probability of being James’s father is just zero.</p><p>Then, the former player of the NBA, Nate Thurmond, also claimed him to be his son. The fact behind this claim is they both played for Clevland, and both physical features look similar. It was a false claim without sufficient evidence.</p><p>Later on, Ronald Bivens, the former basketball player, claimed him to be his son. He met Gloria while he was 19 years old, and they were often seen together by their friends. Later, Roland changed his name to Anthony. Ronald’s playstyle was similar to that of LeBron’s, as per Roland’s coach. The confusing part of the story is that Ronald was officially recorded to be dead in 1994, whereas Anthony McClelland was caught for robbery in 2002.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo77IrbCgnZ5jsLC5jpqlraCfo8ZuucKco56knJa7pXs%3D</p></div><div id=links><a href=./scooter-smiff-19951206-html.html>&#171;&nbsp;Astrology Birth Chart of Scooter Smiff (Rapper) 2024</a>
