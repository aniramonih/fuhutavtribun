Kaitlyn was forced to rehash her relationship with runner-up, Nick Viall, and things got awkward pretty quickly — hardly a surprise given that this was Nick's second time losing The Bachelorette.</p><p>Check out highlights from Kaitlyn and Nick's confrontation below, plus Nick's epic face-to-face with Shawn.</p><p><strong>Nick Comes Clean: I Was Immature</strong></p><p>Nick and Shawn were bitter enemies during The Bachelorette, but Nick was ready to bury the hatchet with his rival. "I'll say this about the whole Shawn thing. At the end of the day it was just pretty silly and unfortunate," he told host <strong>Chris Harrison</strong>.</p><p>Nick said he regretted his actions while watching the season: "I let those frustrations get the best of me," he told Harrison. "I ended up not being much better. We let our immaturity come out; we weren't the best versions of ourselves."</p><p><strong>Nick and Shawn Kiss and Makeup (Or, Sit Awkwardly Next To Each Other)</strong></p><p>Good news, everyone: Chris Harrison encouraged Nick and Shawn to work through their issues, and they kind of made up. At first, Shawn went on the defense, saying, "I can't try to be nice to somebody I don't have a good feeling about," but he eventually agreed to move on. In fact, Shawn accused ABC of over-dramatizing his fight with Nick.</p><p>"There were so many moments that weren't shown because they wanted to get this big feud between us," he said. "It's kinda disappointing."</p><p><strong>Nick Confronts Kaitlyn: "We Said 'I Love You'"</strong></p><p>Remember when <a href=#>Kaitlyn rejected Nick mid-proposal</a>? Well, Nick told her exactly how he felt during ATFR: "We said 'I love you' to each other," he explained. "That was towards the end, and obviously I took that to heart. I'm wondering what you were thinking."</p><p>Kaitlyn wasn't thrilled by Nick's question, responding (with an epic eye-roll), "That's what happens in this world. You get into situations. I think at the end of the day, no love that I had was the one that I had for Shawn. I think that is the only explanation."</p><p><strong>Apparently, Kaitlyn Stole Nick's Perfect Proposal</strong></p><p>The most awkward moment of the night? When Chris Harrison made Kaitlyn and Nick watch his failed proposal in front of a live audience. Nick couldn't control his emotions, and lashed out at Kaitlyn: "Those words I said to you, I'll never have that back. I don't understand what the heck you were thinking, thinking 'There's no good way, but this is the best way to break his heart.'"</p><p>Kaitlyn kind of apologized to Nick, but he wasn't having it. "I wish that there was more consideration for what we had, or more importantly how it would affect me," he said.</p><p><strong>Shawn Is Ready To Stand By His Woman</strong></p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Kaitlyn and Shawn couldn't keep their hands off each other when they took the stage, and the bride-to-be chatted about what's next for them: "We can't wait to go to Starbucks. We honestly just want to start living life. Being around family."</p><p>Shawn reiterated her statement and added, "The best thing that can happen tomorrow morning when I wake up is that I can stand up for my girl and defend her now. This girl is the strongest woman that I've met in my entire life."</p><p>Tell Us: Were you surprised Kaitlyn chose Shawn?</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vJloZrCvp2PCtLnAoJizoZ6ae6S7zGicp6yVp8Gitc2mnKesX6OyuL%2BOm5icoJWhvLOx062cZpmWqbKzedOhnGaemaOurXnRqKqeZaKasKK8jKegnKNdq7aiuMtmmqimlqe8r8DSZqKaoaShxq95kWlobmpobA%3D%3D</p></div><div id=links><a href=./beer-container-with-a-pony-size-html.html>&#171;&nbsp;Beer container with a pony size</a>
