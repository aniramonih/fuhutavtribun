They listed this home for sale in mid-2008 for $23 million. They eventually accepted an offer of $17 million from "Will & Grace" creator <a href=#>Max Mutchnick</a>. Mutchnick and his husband performed a massive renovation on the property. In 2018 Mutchnick sold the home to <a href=# title="Adam Levine Net Worth">Adam Levine</a> for $34 million.

Also in 2014, it was reported that Pete Sampras had purchased a second property in Bel Air, California for just over $3.5 million. This second property was adjacent to the house they had already purchased.</p><p><strong>Thousand Oaks:</strong> In 2009 Pete and Bridgette completed construction on a 16,000 square-foot mansion on Lake Sherman in Thousand Oaks, California. They did not stay in the 20-acre property for long, listing it in March 2021 for $25 million. The mansion comes with a perfectly positioned and lit tennis court, of course, along with seven bedrooms, twelve bathrooms, lots of closets, and a position on a hilltop that allows for privacy and beautiful views of the surrounding countryside.&nbsp; It is basically 16,000 square feet of awesome, including a separate 2,000 square foot gym, and a 1,200 square foot guesthouse. They apparently sold this home in an off-market deal in late 2013 for an undisclosed price, but what was reported to be a bit more than $13 million. The sale price is not listed on the home's recorded price history on public real estate records.</p><p><strong>Bel Air: </strong>At the end of 2013, Pete and Bridgette paid $6 million for a 2-acre property in Bel Air. A few months later, in early 2014, they paid $3.5 million for a neighboring home down the hill from their other property. The Samprases turned that home into a gym and man cave.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuu6bA1qipraBemLyue9GimqGdo6l6pLHLnpmroaSesrR7wJyrqKqjZK%2BztcOgnK2slWLEqrjSqKVmppWperi70a2faA%3D%3D</p></div><div id=links><a href=./carol-minogue.html>&#171;&nbsp;Carol Minogue</a>
