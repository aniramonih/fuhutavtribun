Her nationality is American. She has not shared much about her parents, siblings, and other family details. She also has not shared detailed information about her educational journey or anything about her childhood. However, she did graduate from Texas A&M University College.</p><h2><span id=Career_and_Professional_Life>Career and Professional Life</span></h2><p>Brittany Broski is more commonly referred to as “kombucha girl” in social media platforms. She achieved viral fame in August when one of her TikTok videos in which she is reacting to a sip of kombucha inspired a deluge of memes. This video features her trying kombucha for the first time and displaying a wide variety of facial expressions in reaction to the taste of the beverage.</p><p>Further, she attended Streamy Awards in 2019 where she revealed in an interview that she was working in a bank 4 months prior to the event.

Source: Instagram</p><p>She is a comedy content creator who now boasts over 3.9 million TikTok followers. She also appeared in YouTuber Anthony Padilla’s video titled I spent a day with VIRAL MEME STARS. In the video, they discussed the realities of becoming an online sensation.</p><p>However, the original kombucha video of her viral video didn’t actually inspire very much engagement. She actually owes her viral fame to a particular online community as she revealed in that video. When she first posted the clip on 6th August, the video received only a few thousand likes. Later, things changed for her when Twitter user @jayjuniorrr posted her original video to Twitter.</p><h4><span>After Viral Fame</span></h4><p>Viral fame motivated both personal and professional changes. She was then fired from her then job after she went unexpectedly viral. Broski was working in trust and investment services at a bank, and weeks after explaining her virality to her boss, she ended up getting fired from her promising job as a banker. About this incident, she says:</p><p>She pulls me into her office and she was like, ‘you need to pick if you’re going to be a meme or a corporate professional. I got fired on September 4. A week later I was in LA.</p><p>More precisely, she had her Twitter private with around followers. However, she received over 12,000 requests in a day which keeps increasing day by day. Her original Tiktok video that went viral has since received over 2 million views and likes at present. Similarly, her iconic facial expressions gave rise to hundreds of memes.</p><p>When asked for her advice as a public figure to other creators hoping to become memes, she responds with a laugh, “Don’t do it”. Moreover, talking more in detail about how it feels like to be a public figure, she says:</p><p>Creating viral content, and being a public figure, comes with its challenges. There is pressure to keep up. Every video needs to be better than the last. There is also the pressure to be nice to every single person you met, even when you’re having a bad day.</p><img aria-describedby=caption-attachment-38235 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographymask.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Brittany-Broski-presenting-awards-at-Streamys-2019.jpg alt="Brittany Broski" width=650 height=809 data-sizes="(max-width: 650px) 100vw, 650px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-38235 class=wp-caption-text>Caption: Brittany Broski presenting an award at the 2019 Streamys.
