bribery scheme</a> said that a Ukrainian businessman claimed to keep as “insurance” 15 audio recordings of first son Hunter Biden and two of Joe Biden, a Republican senator revealed Monday.</p><p>Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) made the staggering claim in a Senate floor speech after FBI Director Christopher Wray last week allowed House Oversight Committee members<a href=#> to see a redacted informant file</a> about the claim that Hunter and then-Vice President Joe Biden received $5 million apiece to serve the interests of <a href=#>Burisma Holdings owner Mykola Zlochevsky</a>.</p><p>“Congress still lacks a full and complete picture with respect to what that document really says. That’s why it’s important that the document be made public without unnecessary redactions for the American people to see,” said Grassley, accusing the bureau of needlessly redacting information about the recordings from the file shared with House lawmakers.</p><p>“Let me assist for purposes of transparency,” the 89-year-old went on. “The 1023 [form] produced to that House committee redacted reference that the foreign national who allegedly bribed Joe and Hunter Biden allegedly has audio recordings of his conversations with them. Seventeen total recordings.</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image size-large">Burisma Holdings owner Mykola Zlochevsky allegedly worked with Joe and Hunter Biden. <span class=credit>SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images</span></figure><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image size-large">The FBI source who informed on President Biden’s alleged role in a bribery scheme said that the Ukrainian businessman who allegedly paid off the Bidens also has recordings of the father and son. <span class=credit>REUTERS</span></figure><p>“According to the 1023, the foreign national possesses 15 audio recordings of phone calls between him and Hunter Biden,” Grassley continued. “According to the 1023, the foreign national possesses two audio recordings of phone calls between him and then-Vice President Joe Biden. These recordings were allegedly kept as a sort of insurance policy for the foreign national in case he got into a tight spot. The 1023 also indicates that then-Vice President Joe Biden may have been involved in Burisma employing Hunter Biden.”</p><p>The senator concluded: “So, as I’ve repeatedly asked since going public with the existence of the 1023, what, if anything, has the Justice Department and FBI done to investigate? The Justice Department and FBI must show their work. They no longer deserve the benefit of the doubt.”</p><p>It’s unclear if the FBI has possession of any of the purported tapes.</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image size-large">“Congress still lacks a full and complete picture with respect to what that document really says.
