Chief Wallace holds roll call, Hermann puts his hand up, he says he was wondering about officer’s quarters, it is over a year since he made lieutenant, and he thinks it is time for him. Wallace says no, the alarm goes off.</p><p>There is a house fire, Casey is there, he gives orders. A woman is on the street, she says that the mother in the house is not fit to be a mother. Inside, there is a wheelchair turned over, the team tries to make it upstairs. A woman is on the stairs, she tells them that her seven-year-old son is trapped upstairs.

Meanwhile, Hermann is moving things into his quarters. Kidd goes to see the chief and tells him that she has to do more for young women out there. What if she sets up a program where she recruits young women from Chicago schools to become junior firefighters. Chief says it sounds good, but she will need patience and persistence, and approval. He tells her to call Horton, tell him that she has his full support, it’s a terrific idea.</p><p>Julie drops by to visit Sylvie, she wanted to get some insider knowledge about neighborhoods.</p><p>A woman drops by the station, she asks for Casey, she is Vera from Child & Family Services. It is regarding the house fire earlier that day. She received an endangerment complaining asking for her to remove the child from its mother. Vera sits down with Casey and Chief Wallace. Casey says the mother, Jenny, turned over her wheelchair to get out and tried to crawl up the stairs. Vera distorts everything Casey says and he asks her what her agenda is. She gets up and leaves, Wallace says he didn’t like her attitude. Casey says it doesn’t sit well with him, Vera only wants to remove the child from his disabled mother.</p><p>Hermann has his whole office set up, but it is not soundproof.</p><p>Horton is at the station to see Kidd, she thanks him for responding so quickly. She says she is calling it Girls On Fire, young women can see that there is a career for them in the fire station, make them feel empowered. He tells her to fill out a form, get a female officer to commit with her, and he will take care of it.</p><p>The alarm goes off, it’s a medical assist. On the scene, the is a naked man barricaded in a building, dancing in front of the glass doors. There are officers on the scene and Brett says they are not treating this guy until he is restrained. The officer says nobody is complaining about a crime. Foster tells the officer the man it is public indecency, a misdemeanor. The officer calls her honey, and Foster gets mad. She looks at his body cam and calls him an a-hole. The distraction causes the naked man to run out of the building, it’s a crime now. The owner, Nicholas Winter, is about to go into his building when Brett asks him if he does personal and commercial real estate, he says both, she introduces herself.</p><p>At the station, Wallace tells Casey to go speak to the neighbor who made the complaint about Jenny. Casey and Gallo go to see the neighbor, her name is Arlene. She says Jenny is unfit, she can’t take care of her yard, she has no respect for the property line. She called to get her son taken away because of some yard wired. Casey tells her she is reprehensible, Arlene goes into her house.</p><p>Julie and Sylvie meet with Nicholas Winter in his office before they leave Nicholas asks Sylvie on a date.</p><p>Casey and Gallo go to see Jennifer at the hospital, a woman walks in from child services and tells her that they are removing her child from her home.</p><p>At the station, Casey tells Chief Wallace that it was awful.

The man is transferred by stretcher to the hospital.</p><p>Casey goes to see Vera at Child & Family Services, says he wants to talk to her about Jenny. He says he just came from a call, a warehouse worker almost died, all his friends were trying to help him and they failed. The point is, Noah wasn’t in any more danger because his mother uses a wheelchair, the neighbor is bitter because of tree roots. Vera tells him that it is a matter of family court now. He says he had a son once, his real dad dropped back in the picture, he couldn’t deny the child that love and Tiny pushed it through.
