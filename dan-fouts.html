His father, <strong>Bob Fouts</strong>, is a Bay Area Radio Hall of Fame inductee.</p><p>Notably, Bob served for the NFL club San Francisco 49ers as a play-by-play announcer. Besides, he had four siblings, two brothers and two sisters.</p><p>After all, Dan grew up in his hometown with his dad teaching him the fundamentals of football.</p><p>In the meantime, Dan joined Marin Catholic High School in Kentfield. No surprise, he joined the school’s football team as a starter.</p><p>Later, he completed his final two years of school-level education after shifting to St. Ignatius College Preparatory. Eventually, in 1969, Dan graduated from high school.</p><h3>Collegiate football</h3><p>Soon after leaving school, Dan received a scholarship offer from the University of Oregon in Eugene. Immediately, he accepted the offer to play for the Oregon Ducks.</p><p>Owing to his brilliant performances with the Ducks, he was included in the All-Pac-8 team as a quarterback.</p><p>Furthermore, Dan made as many as 19 records in the college. Notably, he led the Ducks’ history in passing yardage and total offenses.</p><p>Similarly, he recorded 54 interceptions and 37 touchdowns in three years there. As a result, he secured a glorious spot in the university’s hall of fame in 1992.</p><h2>Dan Fouts | Playing career</h2><h3>Early days</h3><p>The San Diego Chargers or now called Los Angeles Chargers, poached Fouts in the third round of the 1973 NFL Draft.</p><p>However, he could not play up to his caliber in his early days at the club. In 1978 the Chargers hired a new head coach <strong>Don Coryell</strong> who changed the fortunes there.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Dan-Fouts-with-his-coach-Don-Coryell-300x300.jpg><p>Coryell’s Air Coryell gained popularity as a passing scheme and philosophy that required the tight end as a key receiver.</p><p>As a result, the team and the new tactics required its quarterback to step up mental and physical abilities. Consequently, Dan began improving himself and eventually became the best fit.</p><h3>Pro Bowl</h3><p>Notably, Fouts was selected to play Pro Bowl for six years from 1979-1983 and 1985. During this, he secured his position in the All-Pro team in 1979 and 1982, and second Team All-Pro in 1980 and 1985.</p><p>Moreover, Dan became the first player to have more than 4,000 passing yards in three successive NFL seasons during 1979-1982.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Dan-Fouts-in-Pro-Bowl-for-the-Chargers-300x200.jpg><p>Likewise, Dan broke Joe Namath’s record for most yards in the American Football League until <strong><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Dan Marino</a></strong> broke again.</p><p>Besides, Dan had an average of 320 yards passing per game in the NFL that was a record until <a href=#>Drew Brees</a> surpassed it in 2011.</p><h3>AFC titles</h3><p>In the meantime, Fouts led the Chargers to the playoffs from 1979 to 1982. During the period, he played in the AFC championship title matches in 1980 and 1981.</p><p>However, he could not earn the Chargers the titles there. Also, he could not lead the team to any of the Super Bowls during his reign at the club.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Dan-Fouts-has-got-a-lot-of-passion-for-the-game-278x300.jpg><p>In fact, the Chargers received criticisms for the poor defense they had during the times. Also, they did not show much interest in returning the ball.</p><p>But after having <strong>Chuck Muncie</strong> in the team in 1980 and <strong>James Brooks</strong> in 1981, their game improved in terms of running.</p><h3>Individual records and role in the team</h3><p>As a matter of fact, Fouts’ teammates and coaches say he was the most physical player on the team. Likewise, he used to drop back from the center to look for a group of receivers.</p><p>Moreover, Dan found the wide receiver <strong>Kellen Winslow</strong> on so many occasions that Kellen led the NFL in receptions for two seasons.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Dan-Fouts-for-San-Diego-Chargers-in-1980-251x300.jpg><p>Similarly, Fouts was protected by an excellent offensive line at the Chargers. With Fouts in the offense, the Chargers were the no. 1 team in NFL for six successive years from 1978-1983 and in 1985 in passing yards.</p><p>Furthermore, Dan led the league in passing yards in four successive seasons from 1979. Also, he surpassed 20 touchdowns for six seasons in his career, with his highest 33 in 1981.</p><p>Similarly, he recorded his career-high passing yards of 4,802 in the 1981 season, setting an NFL record.</p><h3>Notable wins with the Chargers</h3><p>With Fouts, the chargers had a 3-4 win-loss record in the playoff games. Individually, he threw for over 300 yards in five of those games.</p><p>The Chargers’ 41-38 win over the Miami Dolphins in an AFC playoff game in 1982 is remembered as The Epic in Miami.</p><p>Fouts had completed 33 out of 53 passes with 433 yards and three touchdowns at the game.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Dan-Fouts-on-action-for-San-Diego-Chargers-300x186.jpg><p>Identically, the game against Cincinnati Bengals, also called the Freezer Bowl, saw the chargers devasted with a 27-7 loss.</p><p>Next season, he recorded 333 yards passing and three touchdowns in a 31-28 victory against the Pittsburgh Steelers.</p><p>On the whole, Dan became the all-time leader in passing and touchdowns for Chargers when he retired in 1987.</p><p><a href=# rel=noopener><strong>You might want to buy Dan Fout’s signed jerseys, click to
