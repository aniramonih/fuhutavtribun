Mugshot, Charges, and Sentence</h1><div id=sub-header>August 2024 · 3 minute read</div><div class=entry-content><p><strong>Let’s find out “Did Ishowspeed Get Arrested” On August 8, 2022, Darren Watkins Jr., better known on YouTube as Ishowspeed, was taken into custody while doing a live stream from his home.</strong></p><p>American YouTuber Ishowspeed has over 10 million subscribers and is well-known for his contentious live streams. His past actions have gotten him into a lot of difficulties, including a permanent ban from Twitch and Valorant.</p><p>He became increasingly well-known because of his peculiar behavior, but he has continued to grow steadily on YouTube. He has received criticism for his activities, yet he was unaffected and persisted in them.</p><p>Speed has a history of intimidating others online by making fun of their appearance and issuing threats.</p><h2 id=did-ishowspeed-get-arrested>Did Ishowspeed Get Arrested?</h2><p>Ishowspeed was swatted from his house in Ohio during his live stream.</p><p>The live streamed video on YouTube shows the police officers coming to his house and arresting him. The video was captured by someone else from Speed’s phone after the Ohio authorities handcuffed him.</p><p>The person on the video is heard saying, “You got swatted bro.” The police officers force the cameraman to point the mobile phone in a different direction.</p><p>People had speculated that he was arrested because he prank-called the police earlier and gave them the wrong address, and before that, in his live stream, he broke his PlayStation and burned his game.</p><p>No official statement has been published related to his arrest. Speed has also been rumored to be arrested, but there was no evidence to back the rumors.</p><p></p><h2 id=ishowspeed-mugshot-charges-and-sentence>Ishowspeed Mugshot, Charges, And Sentence</h2><p>The Cincinnati police have not released any official mugshot of Ishowspeed.</p><p>The authority is currently analyzing the case, so the jail sentence for Speed hasn’t been revealed at the moment. It is not sure what will be the decision he can either be released, or the case might go further.</p><p>The streaming community is not happy as lately, many streamers have been swatted. Recently streamer Adin Ross was also swatted during his gambling stream; there were three police officers searching Ross’s house with weapons. Ross posted a video on his Twitter saying the whole situation was traumatizing.</p><p>He promised his viewers that he would update the whole story; he further added the world we live in is cruel and sick. Top streamer Felix Lengyel was forced to move out of his neighborhood to avoid being swatted on a daily basis.</p><p>The reasons still unknown why the authority is swatting the streamers.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/api.trendingpal.com/uploads/2022/8/695a9f44-1305-4863-bf71-addfab39e1aa.webp><h2 id=ishowspeeds-controversial-moments-from-his-live-streams>Ishowspeed’s Controversial Moments From His Live Streams</h2><p>During the fourth of July, Speed bought various types of fireworks in his bedroom to show his viewers. He decided to light the firework in his room; he screamed as the sparks went off. Luckily, the other boxes were not caught in the sparks, and no one was hurt. As the clip went viral, many criticized him for his immature and reckless behavior.</p><p>The clip of his misogynistic rant went viral; he started his rant when he was criticized by his teammate while playing Valorant. When his female teammate told him he was terrible at the game, he told her to stop playing the game and clean her husband’s dishes. People were unhappy with him and asked Riot Games and YouTube to take action. He was permanently banned from all the Riot Games.</p><p>Speed had threatened to sexually assault the TikTok star Ash Kaash during E-date on Twitch. He had posed a hypothetical question on whether Kaash would help him to repopulate the earth if they were two people left.</p><p>The TikTok star responded she would not as it would require their children to inbreed. He again responded by saying who would stop him even though Kaash said she would, he asked the question repetitively in an aggressive way which resulted in him being permanently banned from Twitch.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmhqZGy7psPSmqmorZ6Zwamx1qippZxemLyue5FtbmaalajBcLDInWSiq5ikxLS8xJ6bZp%2BVqXqivtGeqq2dlGQ%3D</p></div><div id=links><a href=./dylan-penn-net-worth.html>&#171;&nbsp;Dylan Penn Net Worth | Celebrity Net Worth</a>
