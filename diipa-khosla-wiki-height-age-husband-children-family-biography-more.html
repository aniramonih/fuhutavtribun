Social Media Celebrity Death Rumors Hoax Surface Online</strong></p><h2>Husband and Kids</h2><p>She met Oleg Büller for the first time when she was going to college in Amsterdam. Oleg works for the Dutch Foreign Service as a diplomat. She talked about the event in an interview. She told me,</p><p>I got there on the first day, but I was late because I have an Indian passport and had trouble getting a visa. So, most of the new students had already made friends and done everything else. My parents dropped me off at the main reception, and the first guy I saw is now my husband.”</p><p>Later, they met on Facebook, and their friendship quickly turned into love. After going out together for a few months, Oleg asked Diipa to marry him. In an interview, Diipa talked about how Oleg asked her to marry him. She told me,</p><p>He planned an event at the Devigarh Palace in Udaipur with the theme “Vogue India Christmas Dinner.” But when the day came, I found Oleg sitting on his knee at the end of this Indian palace’s beautiful courtyard. I was glad to not go to dinner!”</p><p>In September 2018, the couple got married at the Fateh Garh Palace in Udaipur, Rajasthan. The wedding took four days. They had wedding ceremonies in both the Punjabi and European styles. Sabyasachi Mukherjee and Piny Michaeli, two of India’s best-known fashion designers, made Diipa’s nine wedding outfits.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/smartindianews.in/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Diipa-Khosla--300x244.png><h2>Career</h2><p>In February 2014, she began working at IMA in Amsterdam, Netherlands, as a social media manager. In January 2015, she started working as a fashion influencer and put up her website, DiipaKhosla.com. In an interview, she talked about how she got to where she is now as a fashion influencer.</p><p>Wasn’t simple. It was only possible by working hard and setting very clear goals. I want to tell all the young people this. Know what you want to achieve. Think as clearly as if you were saying, “I want to be in Times Square!” You can figure out how and when it will happen, but just be clear.”</p><p>In 2019, she started the non-profit organization “Post For Change” to support women’s rights. She talked about her NGO in an interview. She told me,</p><p>Now, I’m working on a project to help get menstrual hygiene products to 250,000 rural women. That’s what I like best about what I do: I can have an effect on the things that have meant the most to me. I’ve been on the cover of international magazines, won awards for being an influencer, spoken to British Lords on Women’s Day, and been on billboards. But what really matters is that this platform has given me a reason to do something. It’s helped me turn all the bad things that have happened to me in my life into something good. It has given me a shield that lets me fight for those who can’t.”</p><p>I wanted to help people, so I went to school for Human Rights Law. I got my degree and then did an internship with an influencer agency in Europe. That’s where I found the world of social media. At first, I started a fashion blog. I was nervous, but I forced myself to leave my comfort zone. Over the next few years, my account grew, and I realized I had a voice that could reach thousands of people. So, I also made a page for women’s empowerment, which is a cause close to my heart. I wanted to help women who were having trouble with gender inequality and mental health issues.</p><p><strong>Also Read:&nbsp;Bhavana Wiki, Biography, Age, Husband, Family, Education, Height, Weight, Movies List, Career, Profession, Net Worth</strong></p><h2>EDUCATION</h2><p>Diipa has always wanted to change the world by becoming a lawyer. She cares about other people and wants to help them get better. She went to a British boarding school in South India to finish school.</p><p>She then went abroad to finish high school and get her Master’s in Law. She worked with UNICEF to help people by using what she had learned in school.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/smartindianews.in/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Diipa-Khosla-1-300x221.png><h2>Social media’s social side</h2><p>Since she quit practicing law almost seven years ago, 31-year-old Büller-Khosla has become a self-made global influencer with 1.4 million followers (and growing). She has worked with 12 well-known brands, including Louis Vuitton, Fendi, Bulgari, and Dior. She has also been on the covers of 18 magazines around the world, walked the red carpet at Cannes, been named an influencer, and won TEDx awards. “I’ve always been a business owner in everything I’ve done. “It’s the Punjabi in me,” says Büller-Khosla with a smile. I soon find out that she takes being successful very seriously.</p><p>Even though she already had a busy schedule, she had promised herself when she was 12 that she would be pregnant before she turned 30. And when the pandemic started in March 2020, it seemed like the perfect time. She got pregnant a month before she turned 30, and she worked hard to grow her business idea while she was pregnant and after the baby was born.</p><p>Now, on September 18, the launch video for Büller-much-anticipated Khosla’s beauty line, Ind Wild, will be released. This will create a lot of buzz for a few weeks until her first two products go on sale on October 11. People say that Ind Wild is a beauty line that uses both Ayurvedic superfoods and clean chemistry. “My mom is a dermatologist and an Ayurvedic doctor, so I’ve been obsessed with skincare and the science behind it since I was a little girl,” says Büller-Khosla. It seems like a brave move to move away from social media, but all bets are on her street cred.</p><h2>AWARDS AND RECOGNITIONS</h2><ul><li>First Indian influencer to be on the cover of The Telegraph India newspaper.</li><li>First Indian influencer on the cover of UK’s Asian magazine, Kush Wedding Magazine.</li><li>Featured in Pakistan’s Grazia September 2019 issue and titled Insta Queen</li><li>First Indian influencer to be on the cover of Conde Nast Traveller India February 2019 edition.</li><li>First Indian influencer to be on the cover of Brides magazine (UK’s largest bridal magazine) November 2018 issue</li></ul><h2>Personal life</h2><p>Diipa was born in August 1991 in New Delhi, India.
