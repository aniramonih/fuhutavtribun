born on September 14, 2009, in New Oxford, Pennsylvania, USA. She is the daughter of the late reality TV personality Valerie Fairman, known for her appearance on the show “16 and Pregnant.” Tragically, Valerie passed away on December 21 due to a drug overdose, leaving Nevaeh orphaned at the age of seven.</p><p>Following Valerie’s demise, Janice Fairman, Nevaeh’s adoptive grandmother, has played a crucial role in providing care and support for her. Nevaeh has managed to cope relatively well with the loss of her mother, excelling in her studies and not requiring extensive counseling. Before Janice gained full custody, Nevaeh had limited contact with her mother, which facilitated the transition for her.</p><p>Nevaeh’s biological father, Matt Pryce, remains an active presence in her life, visiting her regularly on Saturdays. Despite facing his own challenges, efforts have been made to ensure his involvement in Nevaeh’s upbringing, allowing her to experience important milestones. In the familiar environment of her upbringing, Nevaeh continues to cherish the love and memories of her late mother through keepsakes like a necklace containing Valerie’s ashes and flowers from the service.</p><p>The family’s journey has been marked by both sorrow and resilience, with Janice Fairman expressing her belief that Valerie’s appearance on “16 and Pregnant” influenced her struggles with addiction and the opioid epidemic. Despite the hardships, the family remains dedicated to supporting Nevaeh and preserving the memory of her late mother.</p><p><span></span></p><table cellspacing=0><tbody><tr><td><p>Full Name</p></td><td><p>Nevaeh Fairman</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Date of Birth</p></td><td><p>September 14, 2009</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Place of Birth</p></td><td><p>New Oxford, Pennsylvania, USA</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Mother</p></td><td><p>Valerie Fairman (deceased)</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Adoptive Grandmother</p></td><td><p>Janice Fairman</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Biological Father</p></td><td><p>Matt Pryce (occasionally involved in her life)</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Status</p></td><td><p>Living with adoptive grandmother</p></td></tr></tbody></table><h2>Unveiling Valerie Fairman’s Persona</h2><p>Valerie Fairman rose to fame as a reality TV star, particularly known for her role on “16 and Pregnant.” Born on October 6, 1993, Valerie’s journey through teenage pregnancy was captured on MTV’s show, providing a glimpse into the challenges of young motherhood.
