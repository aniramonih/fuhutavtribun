Even when he was shot in the Season 3 finale, he survived and is still very much alive.</strong></p><p>There is, however, the possibility that the character may be killed off as the actor that portrays him, Kevin Costner, is set to depart the series. However, this may not happen as Yellowstone is already coming to an end.</p><h2><strong>Does John Dutton Die in Yellowstone?</strong></h2><p>Yellowstone is still an ongoing series, with the second part of the finale season (i.e., season 5) set to be aired sometime in November 2023. Until that happens, we will not know the real fate of the characters. However, we can say that John Dutton has not died in Yellowstone. There have been some attempts on his life, though, and this is not surprising given his position.</p><p>John Dutton, or more appropriately John Dutton III, heads the Dutton family that controls the largest contiguous ranch in the United States of America, and they have to contend with several adversaries, including Native Americans, environmental groups as well as real estate developers, all seeking to reduce the size of their homestead. One of these groups eventually makes an attempt on John Dutton’s life in the Season 3 finale of Yellowstone.</p><h3><strong>John Dutton&nbsp;Survived Multiple Gunshot Wounds in The Season 3 Finale</strong></h3><p>John Dutton nearly died following an armed attack in Yellowstone Season 3 finale. The Season 3 finale witnessed attacks on the key members of the Dutton family, including Beth (John Dutton’s daughter), who gets bombed in her office, and Kayce (Dutton’s son), who is a victim of an armed attack. John Dutton himself is also attacked.</p><p>He had stopped over to help a stranded lady and her son change their flat tire when a vehicle rolled over, and one of the occupants asked him if he was John Dutton. Immediately he replied in the affirmative, multiple gunshots were fired at him, and his assailants immediately drove away. The Season 3 finale ended on this cliffhanger, and as such many people assumed that John Dutton must have died, but this was not the case when Season 4 Episode 1 premiered.</p><p>In Episode 1 of Season 4 of Yellowstone, we find out that Dutton sustained some serious injuries, but his saving grace is that his cell phone in his pocket prevented what would have been a fatal bullet shot from hitting his chest. He is taken to the hospital and is treated for his wounds. He is able to recover completely and bounces back to resume control of his empire.</p><h3><strong>John Dutton’s Character Could Still Be Killed Off Due To Kevin Costner’s Departure</strong></h3><p>There is a possibility that John Dutton could still be killed off in Yellowstone, and this is because the actor that portrays the role, Kevin Costner, has made it known that he is walking away. Costner, the major star of the series, doesn’t see eye to eye with Taylor Sheridan, the creator of the series, and the dispute between them is a protracted one.</p><p>It has already been confirmed that Yellowstone would end after the second part of Season 5, but it is thought that Kevin Costner may even refuse to film the second installment of Season 5. If that happens, then the character of John Dutton will have to be written out of the show, and one of the ways to achieve this is through him being killed off.</p><h2><strong>Does John Dutton Die in Yellowstone 1923?</strong></h2><p>John Dutton died in Episode 3, Season 1 of 1923, after being shot by Banner Creighton, an Irish sheepherder who had a long-running dispute with the Duttons because he wanted to graze his sheep on their field. The Duttons had earlier clashed with Banner in Episode 2, Season 1, and were able to deal with him and his fellow Irishmen.</p><p>He later ambushed them in Episode 3 and was able to get the upper hand, killing John. The John Dutton who died in 1923 is not John Dutton III in Yellowstone. 1923 is a sequel series to Yellowstone, and as such, the “John Dutton” in 1923 is the great grand uncle of John Dutton in Yellowstone.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiaqaG2r7HRZ5qopV%2BZvKa%2FjKOmoaZdmcK1wM6nZJ2hlWK2r3nYnqOlp6eowbC6xGg%3D</p></div><div id=links><a href=./doug-burgum-net-worth-career.html>&#171;&nbsp;Doug Burgum Net Worth, Career, Wiki, Age, Wife, Ethnicity, Height</a>
