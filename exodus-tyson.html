In the 80s, Tyson seemed untouchable, but over the years, he’s tarnished his legacy regularly with arguments, bad manners, and at times painful events.</p><p>Although Tyson has many enemies in and out of the ring, no one, even in their worst dreams, could want the boxer to go through the darkest moment of his life: the untimely disappearance of his daughter, Exodus. Neither the world nor Tyson and his former mate Sol could beat the grief over Exodus’ death. However, they are doing their best and are always there for their other children.</p><p>In the meantime, let’s try to relive the days when Exodus was still alive and thriving – just like any other child.

Here is a detailed biography timeline of Exodus Tyson’s life.</p><ul><li><strong>2005: </strong>Exodus Tyson was born in Phoenix, Arizona.</li><li><strong>2002:</strong> Tyson and Turner file for divorce, and Turner is granted custody of Exodus and her older brother Miguel.</li><li><strong>2009:</strong> Exodus is found unresponsive and tangled in a cord on a treadmill at her family’s home in Phoenix. She is rushed to the hospital but is pronounced dead shortly after that.</li><li><strong>2010:</strong> The Tyson family established the Exodus Tyson Memorial Fund to raise money for children’s charities in honour of Exodus.</li></ul><h3 class=wp-block-heading id=exodus-tyson-childhood-and-death><span id=Childhood_and_Death><strong>Childhood and Death &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></span></h3><p>Exodus Tyson was born to Mike Tyson and Sol Xochitl in March&nbsp; 2005. She is a Muslim African-American girl. Her neighbours in Exodus describe her as an active and often busy young girl. She repeatedly cycled from house to house, playing with her friends.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.webofbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Exodus-Tyson-Age.jpg><h3 class=wp-block-heading id=terrible-accident-and-death><span id=Terrible_Accident_and_Death><strong>Terrible Accident and Death</strong></span></h3><p>Exodus lived with her mother in Phoenix until she died in a terrible accident. Her mother cleaned the house in the accident while playing in the playroom.</p><p>When Sol sends Miguel to care for Exodus, he finds his sister tied around her neck and immediately contacts his mother.</p><p>Sol quickly cut the line and dialled 911. She was on life support after being taken to St. Hospital and Medical Center. Sadly, she passed away on May 26, 2009, at 11:45 a.m.</p><p>Police questioned Exodus’ brother and mother as part of the investigation. They later discover that her death was the result of a tragic accident.</p><p>Exodus’ tragic death reminds parents that home exercise equipment can be fatal. Therefore, they should know it is unplugged and kept out of their children’s reach.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading id=siblings><span id=Siblings><strong>Siblings</strong></span></h3><p>Mikey Lorna Tyson, her brother, was born in Kimberly Scarborough. Mikey is an oversized model who has appeared on the covers of several publications. Rayana Tyson, her second brother, is the first child of Mike Tyson from his father’s second marriage. Rayana received her Bachelor’s degree in Film Studies from New York University. She was nominated for Best Picture by Rayana University in 2016. She then joined the cast of the 2019 hit film “Joker” alongside Joaquin Phoenix.</p><p>Exodus Tyson’s brother, Amir, is the second child of Mike Tyson’s second wife. Amir graduated from American University in Washington with a degree in broadcasting journalism. Amir is currently the CEO of Debonair Attire, a streetwear brand.</p><p>Miguel Tyson, Exodus’ only biological brother, was next. Currently, he is&nbsp; 18 years old. He devotes his time to charitable works. Miguel also enjoys boxing, as evidenced by the fact that he watched boxing with his father.</p><p>Finally, Exodus has two half-siblings that she has never met. Milan and Morocco are her mother-in-law and Mike’s current wife, Lakiha Spicer’s children. Milan is training with Patrick Mouratoglou, the coach of Serena Williams, to become a professional tennis player.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading id=parents-net-worth><span id=Parents_Net_Worth><strong>Parents Net Worth</strong></span></h3><p>In 2021, Mike Tyson will have an estimated net worth of $10 million. However, many may be surprised why the world’s highest-paid former boxer has a low net worth. It is caused by a lack of proper money management and a lavish lifestyle, spending vast amounts on houses, cars, and big cats.</p><p>Additionally, in 2003, Tyson filed for bankruptcy, saying he owed $23 million. These days, however, Tyson makes money from his Tyson Ranch, selling over £500,000 a month worth of medical marijuana. He also hosts a popular podcast called “Hotboxin` with Mike Tyson. In addition, he invests in several small businesses. Additionally, Mike Tyson has launched Mike Tyson’s Legends Only League.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading id=trivia><span id=Trivia><strong>Trivia</strong></span></h3><ul><li>Exodus Tyson is the late daughter of famous boxer Mike Tyson and his ex-girlfriend, Sol Xochitl.</li><li>Her neighbours in Exodus describe her as an active and often busy young girl.</li><li>Exodus’ tragic death reminds parents that home exercise equipment can be fatal.</li><li>She passed away on May 26, 2009, at 11:45 a.m.</li></ul><h3 class=wp-block-heading><span id=Frequently_Asked_Questions><strong>Frequently Asked Questions</strong></span></h3><strong class=schema-faq-question>Who was Exodus Tyson?</strong><p class=schema-faq-answer>Exodus Tyson was the daughter of former professional boxer Mike Tyson and his ex-wife, Sol Xochitl.</p><strong class=schema-faq-question>When was Exodus Tyson born?</strong><p class=schema-faq-answer>Exodus Tyson was born in March 2005.</p><strong class=schema-faq-question>What happened to Exodus Tyson?</strong><p class=schema-faq-answer>Tragically, Exodus Tyson passed away on May 26, 2009, at Four.</p><strong class=schema-faq-question>How did Exodus Tyson die?</strong><p class=schema-faq-answer>Exodus Tyson accidentally got entangled in a cord hanging from a treadmill and sustained a severe injury that proved fatal.</p><strong class=schema-faq-question>Where did the accident happen?</strong><p class=schema-faq-answer>The accident occurred at Mike Tyson’s home in Phoenix, Arizona.</p><strong class=schema-faq-question><strong>Who is Exodus Tyson’s mother?</strong></strong><p class=schema-faq-answer>&nbsp;Exodus Tyson’s mother is Sol Xochitl.</p><strong class=schema-faq-question><strong>What happened to Mike Tyson’s daughter Exodus?</strong></strong><p class=schema-faq-answer>The four-year-old Exodus Tyson accidentally hung herself with a treadmill cord in her mother’s house in Phoenix.</p><strong class=schema-faq-question><strong>How did Mike Tyson lose his child?</strong></strong><p class=schema-faq-answer>The four-year-old daughter of Mike Tyson accidentally hung herself with a treadmill cord in her mother’s house in Phoenix.</p><strong class=schema-faq-question>Did Mike Tyson witness the accident?</strong><p class=schema-faq-answer>Mike Tyson discovered Exodus Tyson’s life-threatening condition after finding her with the cord wrapped around her neck.</p><strong class=schema-faq-question>Were any charges filed regarding the incident?</strong><p class=schema-faq-answer>No charges were filed about the accident, as it was determined to be a tragic accident rather than a result of negligence.</p><strong class=schema-faq-question>Did Exodus Tyson have any siblings?</strong><p class=schema-faq-answer>Yes, Exodus Tyson had siblings.
