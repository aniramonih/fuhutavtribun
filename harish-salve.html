He served in the position till 3 November 2002.&nbsp;Following the completion of his initial three-year term in 2002, the Indian government extended an offer for him to be nominated for a second three-year term. However, he declined the offer by citing some “personal reasons.”</li></ul><ul><li>While working as a lawyer for the Indian government, he handled some significant cases. These included the first anti-dumping case in the Supreme Court and the first case involving the privatization of public sector undertakings (PSUs), known as the BALCO (Bharat Aluminium Company Ltd.) case.</li></ul><ul><li>In 2002, he was appointed as Amicus Curiae by the Supreme Court in a&nbsp;Public Interest Litigation that aimed to secure proper investigations into riot cases in Gujarat that came out from the 2002 riots.</li></ul><ul><li>In 2003, under the direction of the National Human Rights Commission, Harish Salve handled the rape case of a survivor of the Gujarat Riots named Bilkis Bano.

This change was influenced by his father, who was also pursuing a career in the same field. Later, his father started working only on income-tax matters, which led to his introduction to Nani Palkhivala, who was working with Harish’s father at that time. This experience significantly influenced Harish Salve, making him more interested in income-tax matters, which ultimately led him to pursue a career as a lawyer specializing in the field.</li></ul><ul class="related_post wp_rp"><li data-position=0 data-poid=in-398782 data-post-type=none><a href=# class=wp_rp_thumbnail><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/starsunfolded.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Deepak-Nehra-150x150.jpg alt="Deepak Nehra Height, Weight, Age, Girlfriend, Family, Biography & More" width=150 height=150 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a><a href=# class=wp_rp_title>Deepak Nehra Height, Weight, Age, Girlfriend, Family, Biography & More</a></li><li data-position=1 data-poid=in-256686 data-post-type=none><a href=# class=wp_rp_thumbnail><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/starsunfolded.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Ram-Siya-Ke-Luv-Kush-150x150.jpg alt="“Ram Siya Ke Luv Kush” Actors, Cast & Crew: Roles, Salary" width=150 height=150 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a><a href=# class=wp_rp_title>“Ram Siya Ke Luv Kush” Actors, Cast & Crew: Roles, Salary</a></li><li data-position=2 data-poid=in-455065 data-post-type=none><a href=# class=wp_rp_thumbnail><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/starsunfolded.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Sridevi-Menon-150x150.jpg alt="Sridevi Menon Height, Age, Children, Family, Biography & More" width=150 height=150 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a><a href=# class=wp_rp_title>Sridevi Menon Height, Age, Children, Family, Biography & More</a></li><li data-position=3 data-poid=in-230955 data-post-type=none><a href=# class=wp_rp_thumbnail><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/starsunfolded.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Manjiri-Pupala-150x150.jpg alt="Manjiri Pupala Age, Boyfriend, Family, Biography & More" width=150 height=150 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a><a href=# class=wp_rp_title>Manjiri Pupala Age, Boyfriend, Family, Biography & More</a></li><li data-position=4 data-poid=in-42417 data-post-type=none><a href=# class=wp_rp_thumbnail><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/starsunfolded.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Navya-Naveli-Nanda-1-150x150.jpg alt="Navya Naveli Nanda Height, Age, Boyfriend, Family, Biography & More" width=150 height=150 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a><a href=# class=wp_rp_title>Navya Naveli Nanda Height, Age, Boyfriend, Family, Biography & More</a></li><li data-position=5 data-poid=in-316209 data-post-type=none><a href=# class=wp_rp_thumbnail><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/starsunfolded.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Project-9191-150x150.jpg alt="Project 9191 (SonyLIV) Actors, Cast & Crew" width=150 height=150 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a><a href=# class=wp_rp_title>Project 9191 (SonyLIV) Actors, Cast & Crew</a></li><li data-position=6 data-poid=in-79740 data-post-type=none><a href=# class=wp_rp_thumbnail><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/starsunfolded.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Sheldon-Jackson-150x150.jpg alt="Sheldon Jackson (Cricketer) Height, Weight, Age, Wife, Biography & More" width=150 height=150 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a><a href=# class=wp_rp_title>Sheldon Jackson (Cricketer) Height, Weight, Age, Wife, Biography & More</a></li><li data-position=7 data-poid=in-533935 data-post-type=none><a href=# class=wp_rp_thumbnail><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/starsunfolded.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Jagdish-Devda-150x150.jpg alt="Jagdish Devda Age, Caste, Wife, Family, Biography & More" width=150 height=150 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a><a href=# class=wp_rp_title>Jagdish Devda Age, Caste, Wife, Family, Biography & More</a></li></ul><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmirpJa%2FtMHNn6alnJWZe6S7zGifmqqZqLVuv8ClrZ5n</p></div><div id=links><a href=./haydn-gwynne-cause-of-death.html>&#171;&nbsp;Haydn Gwynne Cause of Death: What We Know About the Actress Passing</a>
