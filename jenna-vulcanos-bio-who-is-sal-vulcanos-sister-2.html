Her sister is called Dana Vulcano, who is currently married with children, and her brother, Sal Vulcano, is a renowned comedian – and the founder of Impractical Jokers.</p><p><a href=# rel="noopener nofollow external noreferrer" data-wpel-link=external><img decoding=async fetchpriority=high src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/buzzsouthafrica.com/us/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2022/01/PicsArt_11-19-09.51.10-1.jpg alt="Jenna Vulcano" width=696 height=608 sizes="(max-width: 696px) 100vw, 696px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a></p><p>Jenna has a good relationship with her family members, especially her brother and father. However, her love for her father can make other fathers envious of Sal Vulcano Sr. She always refers to her father as her king and best friend. According to Jenna Vulcano, her father loves her unconditionally and has always been supportive of her.</p><h3><strong>She Graduated From Kingsborough College</strong></h3><p>There is currently no information as regards the elementary school Jenna Vulcano attended. However, we know that she attended Monsignor Farrell High School in Staten Island in New York, where she was born. After graduating high school, Jenna decided to further her education. On that note, she applied to Kingsborough College in Brooklyn and was accepted. At college, she studied Public relations and earned herself a degree.</p><h2><strong>Vulcano Worked As A Medical Receptionist Before Appearing on&nbsp;</strong><strong>Impractical Jokers</strong></h2><p>Jenna Vulcano worked as a coordinator and receptionist. As of 2021, she worked as a medical receptionist in Staten Island. Her certificate as a public relations officer makes her suitable to work as a public relations officer. Although her work as a receptionist aligns with what she studied in college, it did not make her famous. Jenna only became famous when she started featuring in her brother’s reality comedy show.</p><p>After Jenna’s parents got divorced, she grew up spending more time with her brother, making them develop a strong bond with each other. However, both of them did not follow the same career path – she studied to become a public relations officer while her brother pursued a career in comedy.&nbsp;On several occasions, she has appeared on her brother’s comedy show dubbed Impractical Jokers. And each time she appeared, Jenna Vulcano has made the viewers anticipate another episode where she will be featured.</p><p>The first episode she featured in was titled “Strip High Five.” In 2013, she made her second appearance on the show in the episode titled “Down in the Dump.”&nbsp;In this episode, Jenna, her brother, and his friends were in a vacation resort, and she was in a slideshow presenting with her brother and Joe Gatto. In this episode, she was seen kissing Brian Quinn, who was standing naked.</p><h2><strong>In an episode of the Show, Jenna Married James Murray, But the Union was </strong><strong>Annulled That Same Day</strong></h2><p>One of the most remarkable episodes of Impractical Jokers that Jenna featured in was the episode titled “Brother-in-Loss.” The prank she pulled on her brother in this episode of the show is probably the funniest and most interesting. In that particular episode, Jenna Vulcano and James Murray invited their friends and family for their wedding. They even went as far as creating a video about their love story.</p><p>Sal was confused as he was not expecting his sister to marry his friend just like that. He was so amazed at what was going on that he laughed out so loud that it almost ruined their’ wedding ceremony.’&nbsp;It finally dawned on him that James Murray had married his sister when he saw their marriage papers. The prank was perfectly and successfully pulled, but the joke was on Sal.</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>Oh, 2 more things. Yes I legally married Sal's sister, no joke. And yes we annulled the marriage…after the honeymoon night! Revenge rocks.</p><p>— Murr (@jamessmurray) <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">October 31, 2014</a></p><p>The marriage between James Murray and Jenna Vulcano was called off that same day. They only got married to prank Sal. For James, it was his way of getting back to Sal. He was getting back at Sal for forcing him to get a skydiving ferret tattoo and skydiving out of a plane. There are reports that even though Jenna’s marriage to James was staged and annulled, she still makes reference to him.</p><h2><strong>Is Jenna Vulcano Actually Married?</strong></h2><p><a href=# rel="noopener nofollow external noreferrer" data-wpel-link=external><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/buzzsouthafrica.com/us/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2022/01/Jenna-Vulcano3-1170x610-1.jpg alt="Jenna Vulcano" width=696 height=456 sizes="(max-width: 696px) 100vw, 696px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a></p><p>There are contradictory reports about Jenna Vulcano’s marriage.
