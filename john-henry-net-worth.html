Henry & Company (JWH). He is also recognized as the owner of several teams – Liverpool Football Club and Boston Red Sox. John is also the co-owner of Roush Fenway Racing. He also owns the Boston Globe newspaper, His professional career has been active since 1981.</p><p>So, have you ever wondered how rich John Henry is? It has been estimated by sources that John counts his net worth at the impressive amount of $2.1 billion, as of early 2016, which has been accumulated through his successful involvement in the business industry as a businessman and investor.</p><h3>John Henry Net Worth $2.1 Billion</h3><p>John Henry was born to parents who were farmers, and he spent the time in his childhood divided between Arkansas and Illinois. When he was 15 years old, the family moved to Apple Valley, California, where he matriculated from Victor Valley High School, after which he started his studies at Victor Valley College. According to sources from college, he didn’t graduate although he majored in Philosophy, as he began performing in rock ‘n’ roll bands. However, he soon turned to other things, as he started trading corn and learning about the basics of business.</p><p>In no time, John’s professional career burgeoned, and in 1981 he founded the John W. Henry & Company Inc. as a financial trading firm and hedge fund. Little by little his business increased, such that by 2006, it was reported that the total assets under his firm’s management were around $2.5 billion, which has been the main source of John’s net worth. However, the financial crisis hit his firm hard, and in 2012 it was announced that his firm would stop managing client’s assets as of the 31st December 2012.</p><p>Nevertheless, John succeeded in remaining a billionaire, by successfully managing his other businesses. John bought the Florida (now Miami) Marlins in 1999, becoming the sole owner, and sold the Marlins in 2002 to <a href=#>Jeffrey Loria</a>, which certainly increased his net worth.</p><p>After that, he bought the Boston Red Sox, and still owns them. Under his reign, the team has won two World Series, in 2004 and 2013, which also helped add to the overall size of his net worth.</p><p>To speak further of his accomplishments as a businessman, John has started a company – New England Sports Ventures – which in 2010 changed its name to Fenway Sports Group. As the chairman of the Fenway Sports Group, John has bought two European football clubs, Olympiquede Marseille in 2009, and the Liverpool Football Club in 2010.</p><p>That is not all when it comes to John’s career, as he is also the owner of 50 % of the Roush Fenway Racing, a stock car racing team. Furthermore, John bought the Boston Globe, Telegram & Gazette, and Worcester magazines for $70 million in cash, which also subsequently contributed to his net worth.</p><p>Speaking about his personal life, John Henry has been married to Linda Pizzuti since 2009. Previously, he was married to Mai Henry and Peggy Sue Henry(1998-2008). Other information about his private life is unknown, although he is active in free time on social networks such as Twitter and Facebook. Beside that, he is also active in charity work, as he founded The John W. Henry Family Foundation in 2004. His current residence is in Boca Raton, Florida.</p>﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿<table readability=6.3733905579399><tr><td>Full Name</td><td>John W.
