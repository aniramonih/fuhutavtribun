He played there awhile but ultimately returned to New York where he continued building his career in various pubs, clubs, and coffee houses. He was eventually discovered and signed by Jack Somer, an executive at RCA Victor. In 1964, he released his first single called "Everybody Do the Click," which became a hit in the Philippines. In 1965 and 1966, he released his first two albums – "The Voice and Guitar of José Feliciano" and "A Bag Full of Soul."</p><p>In 1966, he performed at a festival in Mar del Platta, Argentina. There, he impressed the RCA Victor executives who wanted him to stay in Argentina in order to record an album in Spanish. What resulted was an album that featured two smash hit singles – "Poquita Fe" and "Usted." From that point onward, Feliciano continued producing very successful singles, albums, and gold records throughout Latin America, as well as within the Hispanic communities in the United States.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-206656 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/vz.cnwimg.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/Jose-Feliciano.jpg alt="Jose Feliciano" width=594 height=417 sizes="(max-width: 594px) 100vw, 594px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-206656 class=wp-caption-text>Alexis C.

The album included a cover of the Doors's song, "Light My Fire." The song became a hit, as did the track that was on the record's B-side, "California Dreamin." A DJ in Seattle had liked the song and began playing it on air. The single took off and reached the third spot on U.S. pop charts and sold over a million copies. It also became a number one hit in countries like Brazil, Canada, and the United Kingdom. Due to his extremely successful year, Feliciano won the 1968 Grammy Award for Best New Artist of the Year as well as the award for Best Pop Male Performance.</p><p>The following year, he recorded two more albums with Rick Jarrard, both of which were certified gold. He also worked with Quincy Jones on the "Mackenna's Gold" movie soundtrack. He recorded the theme song for the film called "Old Turkey Buzzard."

He received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame in 1987. In 2000, he was inducted into the International Latin Music Hall of Fame. In 2011, he was awarded the Latin Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award. Two years later, he was inducted into the Latin Songwriters Hall of Fame.

The album featured a track titled "Feliz Navidad" which was written personally by Feliciano, as he had wanted to contribute a new original song to the album in addition to the recordings of classic holiday tunes. It took him just a few minutes to write and compose the entire track. The song soon became a massive hit and has since been recorded by hundreds of other artists all over the world. It remains one of the most played and downloaded songs during the holiday season even today and has been featured in countless movies and television shows. It was recognized as one of the <a href=#>25 all-time most-played Christmas songs</a> in the world and is also in the Grammy Hall of Fame. Due to its perennial popularity, Jose likely earns hundreds of thousands of dollars in royalties from "Feliz Navidad" every year.
