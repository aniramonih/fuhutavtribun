– Joy McKean, born Mildred Geraldine Joy Kirkpatrick and also known as the Queen of Australian country music, was a renowned Australian country music singer-songwriter.</strong></p><p>She was widely recognized as a pioneer in the industry and played a significant role as the wife and manager of Slim Dusty, one of Australia’s most beloved country music artists. McKean’s daughter, Anne Kirkpatrick, also followed in her footsteps and became a successful country singer and musician.</p><p>McKean’s contributions to Australian country music were immense. She was revered as one of the country’s leading songwriters and bush balladeers, having written many of Slim Dusty’s most popular songs. In 1973, McKean received the inaugural Golden Guitar award for her songwriting masterpiece, “Lights on the Hill.” This accolade marked the beginning of her remarkable success, and she would go on to win the Golden Guitar award an astounding 45 times throughout her career.</p><p>The partnership between McKean and Slim Dusty was a true musical powerhouse. Together, they produced over 100 albums and sold eight million records in Australia alone. Their unique sound and captivating performances captivated audiences across the country, and their adventures as performers were documented in several acclaimed films, including “The Slim Dusty Movie” and “Slim and I.”</p><p>In addition to her musical achievements, McKean received numerous awards and honors. She was bestowed with the Medal of the Order of Australia (OAM) in 1991 for her exceptional services to the entertainment industry. McKean also won several APRA Awards and was inducted into the Australian Roll of Renown in 1983, further cementing her status as a revered figure in Australian country music.</p><p>Joy McKean’s musical journey began at a young age. She made her radio debut around the age of 10 on Sydney’s 2GB radio station, showcasing her impressive talent. Alongside her sister, Heather McKean, she formed the McKean Sisters and gained recognition for their yodeling harmonies. They had their own radio show, “The Melody Trail,” which aired on 2KY and ran from 1949 to 1956. During this time, McKean and Slim Dusty crossed paths, and their enduring partnership began.</p><p>Beyond her contributions as a musician, <a href=# rel=noopener>Joy McKean</a> was instrumental in the development of the Tamworth Country Music Festival and the Country Music Association of Australia. She played an active role in promoting and supporting Australian country music and was involved in various initiatives and organizations dedicated to its growth.</p><p>In her later years, McKean’s legacy continued to shine through. At the age of 90, the documentary film “Slim and I,” directed by Kriv Stenders, provided a heartfelt portrayal of her life with Slim Dusty. The film showcased her remarkable songwriting abilities, and renowned contemporary artists, including Missy Higgins, Paul Kelly, Troy Cassar-Daley, and Keith Urban, paid homage to McKean by covering her songs.</p><p>The documentary film’s soundtrack also featured a new composition by McKean titled “I Don’t Believe You,” co-written with her grandson James Arneman and his wife Flora Smith. This poignant and honest song highlighted McKean’s iconic songwriting prowess and served as a reminder of her enduring talent.</p><p>Joy McKean’s contributions to Australian country music will forever be cherished and remembered. Her indelible mark on the industry, her influential songwriting, and her unwavering dedication to preserving and promoting Australian country music have left an indelible legacy.</p><p>She reportedly died of cancer, and she died on May 25, 2023, and her death is really a big blow to the entertainment fraternity in Australia.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Joy McKean Husband: Was Joy McKean Married?</h2><p>Joy McKean, previously known as Joy Kirkpatrick, tied the knot with Slim Dusty (real name David Kirkpatrick) in 1951.

Following their marriage, Joy’s sister Heather married Reg Lindsay in 1954, and the two sisters embarked on solo careers and collaborations with prominent male country music artists in Australia.</p><p>Joy McKean played a pivotal role in Slim Dusty’s life as his wife and manager for over five decades. Their partnership resulted in an immensely successful body of work. Together, they had two children, Anne Kirkpatrick and David Kirkpatrick, who have also established themselves as accomplished singer-songwriters. In 1964, the family commenced their annual tours across Australia, embarking on a remarkable 30,000-mile, 10-month journey that became the subject of the feature film “The Slim Dusty Movie” in 1984.</p><p>Slim Dusty achieved international recognition with his 1957 hit “A Pub With No Beer” and remained a prominent figure in Australian country music until his passing in 2003. Throughout their partnership, Slim Dusty and Joy McKean released over 100 albums, sold eight million records in Australia alone, and garnered an astounding 45 Golden Guitar awards.</p><p>McKean’s talent for crafting melodic compositions and vivid storytelling enhanced the couple’s musical repertoire.

Among the other popular songs penned by McKean for her husband are “Walk A Country Mile,” “Indian Pacific,” “Kelly’s Offsider,” “The Angel of Goulburn Hill,” and “The Biggest Disappointment.”</p><p>In 1993, the McKean Sisters reunited to record an album titled “The McKeans on Stage.” They also shared the stage with the Slim Dusty Show on multiple occasions during the following decade, leading up to Slim’s passing in 2003. In 2004, a tribute concert called “Concert for Slim” was held in Tamworth, bringing together over 30 Australian music artists.
