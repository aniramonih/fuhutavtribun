K-Fed has custody of Sean Preston and Jayden James <strong>70 percent</strong> of the time, while Britney has unsupervised custody rights for 30 percent of the time. In June 2021, <strong>K-lawyer Fed’s told</strong> People why Britney and K-Fed don’t have equal custody rights. “It would be best if their mother was healthy and happy.</p><p>“And if either of those things isn’t true, it’s not the best place to exercise custody,” the lawyer said. K-lawyer Fed did say, though, that Sean Preston and Jayden James’s father is open to a change in custody once<strong> Britney’s guardianship ends.</strong> “It’s great if [the conservatorship] is no longer needed. Just want to make sure that everything, including how she’s doing, is taken into account if she wants to change the custody order after the conservatorship is over if that ever happens.</p><h2><strong>How much does Britney Spears pay Kevin Federline in spousal and child support?</strong></h2><p><strong>In July 2007</strong>, K-Fed and Britney finally ended their marriage.
