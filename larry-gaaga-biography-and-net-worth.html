He was born on August 25, 1981, to his parents, Mr and Mrs Ndianefo. There are no details of any member of his family that is known to the public. However, it is said that he spent his early years in his home state, where he also had his primary and secondary education.</p><p>Young Larry later moved to Lagos State as he grew much older and more determined to join the music force. There, he bagged a bachelor’s degree from the prestigious University of Lagos, even as he continued working on his music career.</p><h2><strong>Larry Gaaga’s Journey into the Nigerian Music Industry</strong></h2><p>Larry’s music career began to fruition during his University years. He was particularly interested in the business aspect of the music industry.&nbsp; There are claims, however, that he began grooming his musical talent as a teenager when as a member of his church choir. He learnt to play some musical instruments like the piano and drums.</p><p>Some older friends who were grounded in music craft also helped him master the craft. In a short while, he began producing beats for upcoming artists in the Southern part of Nigeria.</p><p>Larry’s foray into the music world began in 2011 though not as a singer but as the general manager at YSG Entertainment. There, he was saddled with the responsibility of helping to foster the career of upcoming rappers like Olanrewaju Ogunmefun, better known as Vector. Soon he was featured alongside 2baba&nbsp;on&nbsp;Vector’s 2010 track “Get Down”.</p><p>After serving the company diligently for five years, he decided to leave and set up his own music label, Gaaga Muzik, in 2017. Silently, Larry Gaaga began making way for himself in the competitive industry. Beginning behind the scenes, he wrote and produced songs for top music stars in the industry.</p><p>He became a household name in the Nigerian music world when <a href=# data-wpel-link=internal>2face Idibia</a> named his 2017 single “Gaaga Shuffle” after one of Gaaga’s famous dance moves. As expected, “Gaaga Shuffle” became a big hit, further paving the way for Larry to showcase his singing talent. The dance move was shown in the song’s music video directed by ace cinematographer Buari Olalekan Oluwasegun – Unlimited LA.</p><p>Larry Gaaga moved further into the spotlight following his collaborations with celebrities like <a href=# data-wpel-link=internal>Davido</a> in his 2018 songs “Doe,” “Wonderful” featuring <a href=# data-wpel-link=internal>Wande Coal</a> and Sarkodie, and “Baba Nla” with 2face, <a href=# data-wpel-link=internal>Burna Boy</a>, and <a href=# data-wpel-link=internal>D’banj</a>. Larry and Idibia’s music collaborations also birthed the song “Iworiwo” in 2019. He also worked with the likes of <a href=# data-wpel-link=internal>Wizkid</a> to produce the song “Low.”</p><p>Gaining wider fame in the entertainment industry, Larry Gaaga had the privilege of producing the soundtrack to the 2019 Nigerian&nbsp;supernatural thriller&nbsp;film Living in Bondage: Breaking Free. Not relenting on his prowess, Larry made the 2020 Love Zone EP with Acetune.</p><p>The 6-track album contains songs like “Deep”, “How”, “Closser,” and “Love” featuring Awilo Logomba. In 2021, he collaborated with Flavor, Queen Theresa and Phyno to produce “Egedege”. In 2022, he worked with Jesse Jagz and Tega Starr to produce “Blessing”.
