Meet Her Mother Sue And Father Heren Sthalekar</strong></p><p>Lisa Sthalekar is a former Australian cricketer with Indian and English ancestors.</p><p>She has been a fan favourite throughout her career and is well-known in international sports media. She has lately been in the spotlight for her comments on players’ performances in this year’s t20 world cup, which is being held in Australia. She accurately predicted the gameplay of several notable players in the game, including Indian cricketing legend Virat Kholi.</p><p>Despite being one of the greatest players of all time, she is also considered as a talented commentator who knows how to play with words and mention current events on the cricket field. She is an ICC and IPL official commentator. She also works as a cricket coach for Slocoach, a sports organisation that offers physical and digital training in a variety of sports for a monthly fee.</p><p>She rose to prominence as one of the world’s most gifted cricketers before becoming a commentator and coach. When rankings were initially created, she was regarded as the world’s best all-rounder. She was a right-handed all-rounder who bowled off-spin.</p><p>She was the first female one-day international player to score 1,000 runs and take 100 wickets. She announced her retirement from international cricket a day after Australia won the 2013 Women’s Cricket World Cup, and she is still regarded as one of the most spectacular women cricketers to ever play for Australia.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.current-affairs.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Lisa-Sthalekar-2.jpg><p><strong>Also Read:&nbsp;<a href=#>Who Is Bradly Rogers Husband of Dani Welniak?

She was born in Pune, India, where her original parents were unable to continue raising her due to financial difficulties, thus she was placed in Shreevatsa, a city orphanage. Her path from being an Indian girl to becoming an Australian cricketing superstar is intriguing.</p><p>Her parents, Haren and Sue Sthalekar, had a strong connection to India because her adopted father was born in Bombay, India, and had been settling in Michigan, USA, for a long time. They discovered the city’s orphanage and travelled there with their older daughter to adopt a boy to round out their family of four.</p><p>They were looking for a baby boy but couldn’t find one, so they had to return to the United States empty-handed. However, they were advised to look at a newborn baby girl, and the couple fell in love with her and chose to adopt her.</p><p>Lisa Sthalekar’s family returned to the United States three weeks after her birth. Prior to relocating to Sydney, the family travelled to Kenya to assist Haren’s work as a Christian missionary. As a result, they satisfied all legal procedures and changed Laila’s name to Lisa.</p><p>When Lisa was a child, her father introduced her to cricket in their backyard. She turned out to be a natural at it. Her father, Haren, liked cricket because it is the most popular sport in India, and he planned to transform his daughter into a well-known cricketer around the world.</p><p>Furthermore, it was one of the most popular sports in Australia, and she fit right in. Lisa turned her passion into a great career full with accomplishments. She became the first woman in one-day international history to take 100 wickets and score 1,000 runs. She is also an effective offspinner. Lisa was a member of four World Cup-winning squads: the 2005 One-Day International World Cup, the 2013 One-Day International World Cup, the 2010 and 2012 T20 World Cups.</p><h2 id=lisa-sthalekars-life-as-a-former-australian-cricketer-and-commentator><span class=ez-toc-section id=Life_Of_Lisa_Sthalekar_As_A_Former_Australian_Cricketer_And_Commentator></span>Life Of Lisa Sthalekar As A Former Australian Cricketer And Commentator<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Lisa was introduced to the sport by her father, and her passion for it hasn’t faded.</p><p>Sthalekar states that her father taught her how to play cricket in the backyard and that cricket is in everyone’s blood in India. Before she realised women could play cricket, Haren took her to a women’s Test match between Australia and England at North Sydney Oval.</p><p>She had no notion that women could play the game until she started playing against boys. Later, she joined the Gordon Club in northern Sydney, where she played weekends with the males before competing against the girls in the afternoon.</p><p>She bowled in her first One Day International against England and ended the British Isles tour with five wickets from the same amount of games. In 2001-02, Sthalekar was promoted to starting batter.</p><p>She hit her first half-century and concluded the season with four. She scored 347 runs in total, breaking her previous four-season total, and took 11 wickets as New South Wales won their sixth straight WNCL title.</p><p>She subsequently went on a one-of-a-kind career as an Australian all-rounder who constantly produced outstanding performances on larger stages. She is unquestionably a legendary player from Australia who is well-known for her professionalism.</p><p>She was admitted into the ICC Hall of Fame in August 2020 for her excellence as an allrounder. Even after retiring at the pinnacle of her career, she went full-time at New South Wales, began commentating for television networks like Channel 7, and began covering overseas leagues like the Indian Premier League.</p><p>For two years, she was the youth consultant for the IPL’s Rajasthan Royals and the Head Coach of the Mosman Men’s Club. Lisa has a natural talent for setting an example for young people, having been the first female to serve on the board of directors of the Australian Cricketers’ Association and a founding member of the WICL.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Childhood_and_Early_Life></span>Childhood and Early Life<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Lisa Caprini Sthalekar was born on August 13, 1979, in Pune, Maharashtra. Her biological parents had abandoned her, and she was living in an orphanage called Shreevatsa, where her adoptive parents, Sue and Haren Sthalekar, first met her. Despite the fact that the couple was trying to adopt a son because they already had a biological daughter named Caprini, Sue fell in love with Laila (Lisa’s given name at the orphanage) and opted to adopt her.</p><p>Lisa’s father, Haren, was born in Bombay, and her mother, Sue, was born in England. They lived in Michigan, USA for a few years before moving to Australia.</p><p>She attended Cherrybrook Public School and Cherrybrook Technology before attending Barker College in Sydney. She received her B.A. in religious studies and psychology from Sydney University.</p><p>Lisa, who was introduced to the sport by her father, had already begun playing cricket during her school days, when she was a member of Cherrybrook’s local West Pennant Hills Cherrybrook Cricket Club.</p><p><strong>Learn More:&nbsp;<a href=#>Joel Klatt’s Wife: Who Is Sara Ordway?
