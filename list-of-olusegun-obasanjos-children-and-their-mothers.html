Though a father of a score, the former President knew all his children by their names.</p><p>In his controversial memoir ‘My Watch,’ the former military leader mentioned that his 20 children, of which 19 are biological and one adopted, are highly successful in their various bids, with about eight of them being d Ph.D. holders in their various fields. To him, this is a great achievement for himself and his generation.</p><p>For someone who had spent much of his life in the military, one would think of the former political leader as an absentee father but on the contrary, he was an ever-present father who carried his children along even as he proceeded in his career. To Obasanjo’s children, he was a disciplined yet very protective father.</p><p>Even though he appears tough on the outside, he is a “true softy” on the inside. The controversial memoir ‘My Watch,’ listed the names of Olusegun Obasanjo’s 20 children&nbsp; to include the following:</p><ul><li>Busola Obasanjo</li><li>Iyabo Obasanjo</li><li>Olusegun Obasanjo</li><li>Olugbenga Obasanjo</li><li>&nbsp;Enitan Obasanjo</li><li>Damilola Obasanjo</li><li>&nbsp;Funsho Obasanjo</li><li>Olumuyiwa Obasanjo</li><li>Funke Obasanjo</li><li>Seun Obasanjo</li><li>Dare Obasanjo</li><li>Olubunmi Obasanjo</li><li>Col Adeboye Obasanjo</li><li>Kofoworola Mojisola Obasanjo</li></ul><p>Only a few of Olusegun Obasanjo’s children listed above are known to the public. This is because they preferred a life of simplicity and free of controversies. However, despite their quiet lifestyles, most of them still came public, mainly for controversial reasons.</p><p>While many of the children have taken to their career paths, quite a number of them have joined their father to make remarkable impacts in Nigeria’s politics or the military. Below are details of the most popular Olusegun Obasanjo’s children.</p><h3><strong>Obasanjo’s First Daughter Iyabo Obasanjo was a famous Nigerian Senator</strong></h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/buzznigeria.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Iyabo_Obasanjo.jpg><ul><li><strong>Full Name: </strong>Iyabo Obasanjo</li><li><strong>Date of Birth: </strong>April 27<span class="LrzXr kno-fv wHYlTd z8gr9e">, 1967</span></li><li><strong>Age: </strong>56 years old</li><li><strong>Occupation:</strong> Politician</li><li><strong>Marital status:</strong> Divorced</li><li><strong>Iyabo Obasanjo’s Husband:</strong> Akeem Bello&nbsp;(m. 1999–2003)</li><li><strong>Iyabo Obasanjo’s Parents: </strong><span class="LrzXr kno-fv wHYlTd z8gr9e">Olusegun Obasanjo,&nbsp;Oluremi Obasanjo</span></li></ul><p>Iyabo Obasanjo is Olusegun Obasanjo’s first child and daughter. She was born on April 27, 1967, and her mother’s name is Oluremi Obasanjo. As the daughter of military personnel, Iyabo traveled a lot during her early year. This affected her basic education as she moved from one school to another.</p><p>She started at Corona School in Victoria Island, Lagos, and then moved to Capital School in Kaduna. Returning to Lagos state, she gained admission to Queen’s College. Iyabo also obtained a degree in Veterinary Medicine from the University of Ibadan in 1988. She got her Master’s in epidemiology from the University of California in 1990 and a Ph.D. in the same course from Cornell University, Ithaca, in 1994.</p><p>Iyabo shares a very cordial relationship with her father. Possibly, her close interaction with her father inspired her interest in politics. Her first political job was as Ogun State Commissioner for Health, after which she was elected as a Nigerian Senator representing Ogun Central Senatorial District of Ogun State under the People’s Democratic Party (PDP) in April 2007.</p><p>Her senatorial ambition, however, ended in 2015, after she was defeated.&nbsp;During her two-term service as a senator, Iyabo was the Chairman of the Senate’s Health Committee and an individual from the Security and Intelligence, Land Transport, Science and Technology, Education, National Planning, and Inter-Parliamentary Committees.</p><p>Though a daughter of a famous elder statesman and a former Nigerian Senator, Iyabo leads a very private life. However, we know that she married Oluwafolajimi Akeem Bello in September 1999, and they welcomed their son Jimi in 2000. The couple separated in 2003,&nbsp; and Iyabo currently lives in the United States of America and works as an assistant professor at the College of William & Mary Department of Health Sciences.</p><h3><strong>scandals involving Iyabo Obasanjo</strong></h3><p>Iyabo has been involved in several controversial issues and being a two-term senator, most controversies involving her are politically related. One such controversy was her heated public fight with her father. This stems from her open attack on her father via an open letter she wrote to him in December 2013.</p><p>The open <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow external noreferrer" data-wpel-link=external>letter</a> has the former senator recounting her father’s parental failings as a father and, among other things, questioning his moral right to criticize others. The letter, which was Iyabo’s response to her father’s criticism of Goodluck Jonathan’s third-term presidential ambition, has the former senator lashing out at her father for condemning a quest he tried while he was President.</p><p>The former senator’s letter was described mainly as one that exposed Chief Olusegun Obasanjo’s character as selfish, corrupt, pretentious, and corrupt, among other things. Nearly a year after, Obasanjo replied to his daughter in portions of his memoirs, My Watch. The memoir has him accusing her of succumbing to the advances of Goodluck Jonathan’s government because of “her character” and “the influence of her mother.”</p><h3><strong>Gbenga Obasanjo</strong></h3><h3><strong><a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer"><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/buzznigeria.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Gbenga-Obasanjo.png alt width=696 height=523 sizes="(max-width: 696px) 100vw, 696px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a> &nbsp;</strong></h3><ul><li><strong>Full Name: </strong>Olugbenga&nbsp; Obasanjo</li><li><strong>Date of Birth: </strong>1971</li><li><strong>Age: </strong>52 years old</li><li><strong>Occupation: </strong>Medical doctor</li><li><strong>Marital Status:</strong> Single</li><li><strong>Gbenga Obasanjo’s Wife:</strong> Mojisola Olayemisi Amope (Div. 2004)</li><li><strong>Gbenga Obasanjo’s Parents:</strong> Olusegun Obasanjo, Oluremi Obasanjo</li></ul><p>Gbenga is Obasanjo’s son with one of his many women. He was born in 1971 and is currently 52 years old. He is the younger brother of Iyabo Obasanjo, so his mother’s name is Oluremi Obasanjo. Olugbenga is a medical doctor by profession. He has a degree certificate in epidemiology, but unfortunately, further details about where he had his education are not known.</p><p>Gbenga is currently single but was previously married to Mojisola Olayemisi Amope. They both changed marital vows in April 2000 and produced three children in four years. The marriage eventually headed for the rocks four years after the doctor accused his father of having an affair with his estranged wife.</p><p>Gbenga not only accused his father and Nigeria’s former President of having sexual relations with his wife before awarding her contracts but also alleged that his wife also slept with her father and other men. This was contained in an affidavit he submitted to the court in response to a messy divorce case already filed by his wife.</p><p>The affidavit also had Gbenga further claiming that the paternity of the three children that are the product of his marriage to Moji was in doubt, considering her alleged multiple sexual relationships with several men. The pair eventually separated in 2004, and Moji was given custody of their children.</p><h3><strong>Adeboye Obasanjo is Obasanjo’s Only Child in the Military&nbsp;</strong></h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/buzznigeria.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Gbenga-Obasanjo.png><ul><li><strong>Full Name: </strong>Adeboye Obasanjo</li><li><strong>Education:</strong> Degree in Engineering</li><li><strong>Occupation:</strong> Soldier</li><li><strong>Marital Status:</strong> Married</li><li><strong>Adeboye Obasanjo’s Wife:</strong> Daisy Nyada (m.2008)</li></ul><p>Colonel Adeboye Obasanjo is military personnel now being referred to as brigadier-general Adeboye Obasanjo after his promotion from colonel to brigadier-general in the Nigerian Army in January 2022.

He also served in many operations and formations in Nigeria and abroad.</p><p>In a book titled “Bitter Sweet My Life with Obasanjo” written by Mrs. Oluremi Obasanjo, Adeboye’s mother was revealed to be a divorcee brought to the former general by one of his aunts who lived in Arigbajo, Ogun State. Oluremi further noted that she was chased out of their matrimonial home in Ikoyi, Lagos state, for challenging the former President’s philandering.</p><p>On September 8, 2014, the senior officer was shot in the leg by Boko Haram in Baza in Adamawa State. Adeboye, then a Lieutenant Colonel, was deployed to the battlefield from 3 Division in Jos, Plateau State. In one of their operations, his platoon was attacked by the terrorist group, leading to the death of 24 soldiers and the loss of an armored tank.</p><p>He was later admitted to Yola Federal Medical Centre, where he received treatment for a few days. Not much is known about Adeboye’s love life, but he is said to be married to Daisy Nyada in 2008, and his father’s mansion at Abeokuta was the venue for the wedding.</p><h3><strong>Dare Obasanjo</strong></h3><p><a href=# rel="noopener nofollow external noreferrer" data-wpel-link=external><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/buzznigeria.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Dare-Obsanjo.jpg alt="Olusegun Obasanjo Children" width=696 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 696px) 100vw, 696px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a></p><ul><li><strong>Full Name: </strong>Oluwa Damilare Obasanjo</li><li><strong>Occupation: </strong>Software Engineer</li><li><strong>Dare Obasanjo’s Parents: </strong>Olusegun Obasanjo</li></ul><p>Dare is a certified Software Developer known to be currently working with Jendalu Ventures, a software development company based in Lagos State. Dare is one of Olusegun Obasanjo’s children who bares a striking resemblance with their father. Unfortunately, there is only a little information we can gather about him.</p><p>Even his social media handles are private except for Twitter which he joined in 2007 and posts mostly about tech-related topics. In an interview he once granted, Dare blames his less social lifestyle on his hectic work life. He also revealed that the program he writes takes a lot of energy and time, but the result is worth it.</p><p>While it is not clear which of Obasanjo’s women had him, we can discover that Dare is married to a white American woman, and their union is blessed with gorgeous kids.</p><h3><strong>Dami Obasanjo</strong></h3><p><a href=# rel="noopener nofollow external noreferrer" data-wpel-link=external><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/buzznigeria.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Dami-Obasanjo.jpg alt width=696 height=491 sizes="(max-width: 696px) 100vw, 696px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a></p><ul><li><strong>Full Name: </strong>Damilola Obasanjo</li><li><strong>Date of Birth: </strong>1982</li><li><strong>Age: </strong>41 years</li><li><strong>Occupation: </strong>Chemical engineer</li><li><strong>Marital Status:</strong> Married</li><li><strong>Dami Obasanjo’s Husband:</strong> Tope Borishade</li><li><strong>Dami Obasanjo’s Parents: </strong>Chief Olusegun Obasanjo, Oluremi Obasanjo</li></ul><p>Damilola Obasanjo is Chief Olusegun Obasanjo’s daughter, with his wife, Oluremi Obasanjo.

Olujonwo’s name came public mostly in 2018, ahead of the 2019’s general election that ushered in <a href=# data-wpel-link=internal>Mohammadu Buhari</a> as Nigeria’s President for a second term. The son of the former President emerged as the new national President of the Buhari Youth Organization (BYO).</p><p>The young politician had expressed willingness to work for Buhari’s re-election bid. In an open letter addressed to Festus Keyamo, Olujonwo urged Nigerian youths to support President Buhari. In June 2017, Olujonwo’s name resurfaced on various social media tabloids as he dragged his wife Temitope to court over domestic violence, intimidation, and threat to his life.</p><p>The young politician claimed that his wife had, since the night of their flamboyant wedding, vowed to take his life. He claimed Temitope told him that she would kill him and nothing would happen.

This helped the young man in no small way to become the successful man he is today.</p><p>Kunle had his primary and secondary education in Ondo, Lagos, and Ogun State. He finally completed his senior secondary education at the Nigerian Navy Secondary School, Abeokuta, Ogun State. As the son of a famous military leader, Churchill had the chance to join the Nigerian Defense Academy to become a Military officer but he chose not to.</p><p>Instead, he traveled to India, where he studied Information Technology at Assam Don Bosco University. In June 2016, ISCG University in the Republic of Benin awarded him an honorary Doctorate Degree. Olakunle is not so much interested in politics as his father, but even as a businessman, he is quite popular in society –&nbsp; thanks partly to his marriage to the renowned Nigerian actress <a href=# data-wpel-link=internal>Tonto Dikeh</a>.</p><p>He married the said actress in 2015 after discovering she was pregnant for him.
