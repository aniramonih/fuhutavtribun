FandomSpot</h1><div id=sub-header>August 2024 · 8 minute read</div><div class=entry-content><span id=dpsp-post-content-markup data-image-pin-it=true></span><p>Thresh is one of those champions whose design is so good that he’s viable in every meta.</p><p>So since he’s probably never going away, it only makes sense to invest into some cosmetics and be the prettiest death sentence at the ball.</p><p>He has a ton of great skins, and I’m looking at all of them to rank his entire catalogue based on overall appeal, features, and price.</p><h3 class="content-title number-title"><span>11.</span> FPX Thresh</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static.fandomspot.com/images/01/25102/11-lol-fpx-thresh-splash-image.jpg><p><strong>Released:</strong> April 30th, 2020<br><strong>Price:</strong> 1350 RP</p><p>It’s never easy to design a champion skin based on an E-sports theme.</p><p>And FPX was just a huge swing and a miss for Thresh.</p><p>The whole theme of some gamer dude transforming into the champion upon respawn feels completely wrong on Thresh, as he’s the dude who kills Power Ranger nerds, not becomes one of them.</p><p>And the character model is a bit too jarring here, as our king of darkness was never supposed to be this shinny.</p><p>I will say that the skin has some high points though, like a pretty good ult wall design, and the most ominous backing animation in his entire lineup.</p><p>But that still can’t get this skin out of last place.</p><h3 class="content-title number-title"><span>10.</span> Pulsefire Thresh</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static.fandomspot.com/images/01/25102/10-lol-pulsefire-thresh-splash-image.jpg><p><strong>Released:</strong> November 21st, 2019<br><strong>Price:</strong> 1350 RP</p><p>Although Pulsefire Thresh was a much better attempt than FPX, I still think it feels too off.</p><p>Thresh is supposed to be spooky and mystical. And there’s just something about sci-fi that makes him look out of place.</p><p>Plus I hate how his head looks here – it makes me think of evil chickens.</p><p>The skin does offer some rather neat features, like some pretty cool particles on your W, and a rather fitting design for your ult walls… but I just can’t get into it.</p><p>Even though it might look slightly better than some of the following skins, it also has quite the hefty price point. Which is why I have to place it so low.</p><h3 class="content-title number-title"><span>9.</span> Unbound Thresh</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static.fandomspot.com/images/01/25102/09-lol-unbound-thresh-splash-image.jpg><p><strong>Released:</strong> July 29th, 2021<br><strong>Price:</strong> 750 RP</p><p>Even though the cinematic that introduced this skin was pretty epic, Thresh mains were not too happy with its release.</p><p>It’s basically just the base skin, but you’re some hot dude – and that’s wrong on so many levels.</p><p>Firstly, being a skeleton is cool as hell. And this makes him feel way more basic.</p><p>Secondly, the lore pretty explicitly states that Thresh was not some sort of fifty shades of green Playboy, so it also feels disingenuous.</p><p>Overall, the skin doesn’t really add anything new to the table. But since it’s so cheap and it technically gives you a bootleg Spirit Blossom skin, I couldn’t put it at dead last.</p><h3 class="content-title number-title"><span>8.</span> SSW Thresh</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static.fandomspot.com/images/01/25102/08-lol-ssw-thresh-splash-image.jpg><p><strong>Released:</strong> May 13th, 2015<br><strong>Price:</strong> 750 RP</p><p>As another E-sport’s skin, this one doesn’t fit Thresh at all either… but I at least have to give Riot some points for creativity.</p><p>Your hair-tentacles are now USB ports, your whip is a cord, and your lantern is the championship cup.</p><p>I mean c’mon, we’ve gotta admit that’s pretty brilliant.</p><p>And the color scheme doesn’t look half bad either.</p><p>Plus, this skin is only 750 RP. And you do get a new recall animation and some minor particle changes, so it’s honestly a rather good deal.</p><p>Not the best, but not terrible.</p><h3 class="content-title number-title"><span>7.</span> Championship Thresh</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static.fandomspot.com/images/01/25102/07-lol-championship-thresh-splash-image.jpg><p><strong>Released:</strong> October 3rd, 2013<br><strong>Price:</strong> 975 RP</p><p>Although this skin doesn’t offer too much, it’s just too iconic to downplay.</p><p>It was the go-to skin for quite a while – and it still doesn’t look half bad.</p><p>The splash art is amazing, the character model improves on the original design, and the new particles compliment the theme effectively.</p><p>Championship Thresh almost has a Lich King vibe, with the different shades of blue and the design for his face now looking like a battle helmet.</p><p>Overall it’s just a very good and simple skin that also carries quite the legacy with it.</p><p>At the very least, this could be considered the best Thresh skin that’s connected to E-sports.</p><h3 class="content-title number-title"><span>6.</span> Deep Terror Thresh</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static.fandomspot.com/images/01/25102/06-lol-deep-terror-thresh-splash-image.jpg><p><strong>Released:</strong> January 23rd, 2013<br><strong>Price:</strong> 975 RP</p><p>Speaking of skins with a long legacy… let’s take a look at Deep Terror Thresh.</p><p>In terms of thematic, this is definitely one of my favorites. The aesthetic fits Thresh way too well.</p><p>Your hook is a crab claw, your lantern is an old-school diving mask, and your face an absolute nightmare.</p><p>This skin offers some pretty nice water and bubble particles to sell the idea further, and you even get a new recall animation where you pull out some treasure.</p><p>So this is an absolute gem that sticks to a great theme & does an excellent job overall, without charging too much.</p><h3 class="content-title number-title"><span>5.</span> Steel Dragon Thresh</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static.fandomspot.com/images/01/25102/05-lol-steel-dragon-thresh-splash-image.jpg><p><strong>Released:</strong> October 21st, 2021<br><strong>Price:</strong> 1350 RP</p><p>This skin sounds like a rather difficult pitch initially, as I don’t really associate Thresh with dragons or braids.</p><p>But it has just enough badass features to somehow make it work.</p><p>The character model here looks fierce, with a really cool armor design, some scales on your hands, and even some wicked dragon claws.</p><p>And the backing animation is also badass, plus the little grumbling dragon sound effect on your W and your ult offers a really nice sense of power.</p><p>Hell, your ult walls even have literal dragons in them!</p><p>So while I’m a bit iffy on the theme and how it fits Thresh overall, this skin has so many badass elements that I’d be a liar if I said I didn’t dig it.</p><h3 class="content-title number-title"><span>4.</span> Spirit Blossom Thresh</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static.fandomspot.com/images/01/25102/04-lol-spirit-blossom-thresh-splash-image.jpg><p><strong>Released:</strong> July 22nd, 2020<br><strong>Price:</strong> 1820 RP</p><p>I know some players are bound to be pissed that this isn’t in the number one spot, but hear me out.</p><p>The demonic form for this skin is all I have ever wanted for Thresh – it both looks amazing and remains in-line with his original champion fantasy.</p><p>But while I do admit that seeing Thresh as human is interesting, I’m not a huge fan of it.</p><p>I like my monster champions to remain monster champions.</p><p>And the fact that Riot <a href=#>made him hot yet again</a> just rubs me the wrong way.</p><p>As a legendary skin, it does offer some really unique features though – like a new auto-attack animation, new emotes, new death and respawn animations, a transformation, and new voice lines.</p><p>But since it carries such a high price tag, and I only really adore half of its design, I have to put it down here in the ranking.</p><h3 class="content-title number-title"><span>3.</span> Blood Moon Thresh</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static.fandomspot.com/images/01/25102/03-lol-blood-moon-thresh-splash-image.jpg><p><strong>Released:</strong> January 8th, 2015<br><strong>Price:</strong> 975 RP</p><p>Sometimes simplicity is key.</p><p>And Blood Moon Thresh is a perfect example of that.</p><p>The character model keeps that same spooky evil vibe from the base skin, but cranks it full of demonic energy. While the particles are just recolored into red to better fit the theme.</p><p>And that was honestly enough to make this skin one of the best there is!</p><p>The splash art is really good, the little ritualistic sound effects on your backing animation give it some immersion points, and the price point is as fair as they can get.</p><p>Sweet and simple!</p><h3 class="content-title number-title"><span>2.</span> High Noon Thresh</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static.fandomspot.com/images/01/25102/02-lol-high-noon-thresh-splash-image.jpg><p><strong>Released:</strong> August 30th, 2018<br><strong>Price:</strong> 1350 RP</p><p>Speaking of sweet and simple, Ghost Rider was such an obvious aesthetic choice for Thresh that I’m surprised Riot didn’t do it sooner!</p><p>The fact that Thresh also a cowboy here makes the whole ordeal even better.</p><p>High Noon Thresh unironically has one of the best splash arts I have ever seen. And the fact that the champion model can live up to that hype is nothing short of a miracle.</p><p>Making his hook a lasso just makes perfect sense, and it worked out better than one could have imagined.</p><p>And just adding simple fire particles to absolutely everything makes this skin truly come to life.</p><p>Also, the fact that his ult is a little corral is straight-up brilliant.</p><p>So really, this skin is amazing in every way. And I nearly put it in the number one spot; a sentiment a lot of you would probably understand.</p><h3 class="content-title number-title"><span>1.</span> Dark Star Thresh</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static.fandomspot.com/images/01/25102/01-lol-dark-star-thresh-splash-image.jpg><p><strong>Released:</strong> June 15th, 2016<br><strong>Price:</strong> 1820 RP</p><p>OK, this skin is so good that it came out with an <a href=#>entire game mode</a>.</p><p>And that’s not something a lot of skins can say.</p><p>Thematically, it hits all of the same notes as the base model – and makes Thresh feel a lot more grand and powerful, feeding off not just normal people, but the universe itself.</p><p>The new voice lines make him feel like the true embodiment of death as well. And the new animations and particles are truly worthy of praise.</p><p>Your W being a literal black hole is great, along with your ult seemingly being made up of the universe itself. And those are just two of the ways this skin makes you feel like the most powerful creature in the room.</p><p>And that’s a vibe that Thresh definitely needed.</p><p>I can’t even begin to list all of the incredible features in this skin, so go buy it for yourself and play around – I have a feeling you’ll like what you see.</p><p>Note: this content was created under Riot Games’ “Legal Jibber Jabber” policy using assets owned by Riot Games.
