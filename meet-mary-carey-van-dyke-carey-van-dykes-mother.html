Mary Carey married into a prominent family in Hollywood, although she seems to be a private person. Here’s all there is to know about her.</p><h3><strong>Summary of Mary Carey Van Dyke’s Bio</strong></h3><ul><li><b>Full name: </b>Mary Carey Van Dyke</li><li><b>Gender:</b> Female</li><li><b>Ethnicity: </b>Caucasian</li><li><b>Nationality: </b>American</li><li><b>Sexual Orientation:</b> Straight</li><li><b>Religion:</b> Christianity</li><li><b>Marital Status</b>: Married</li><li><b>Mary Carey Van Dyke’s Husband: </b>Barry Van Dyke</li><li><b>Mary Carey Van Dyke’s Children: </b>4; Carey, Shane, Wes, and Taryn</li><li><b>Mary Carey Van Dyke’s Height in Inches: </b>5 feet 6 inches</li><li><b>Mary Carey Van Dyke’s Height in Centimetres:</b> 168 cm</li><li><b>Mary Carey Van Dyke’s Weight: </b>68 kg</li><li><b>Mary Carey Van Dyke’s Net worth: </b>$3 million</li><li><b>Famous for: </b>Being the husband of Barry Van Dyke</li></ul><h2><strong>Mary Carey Van Dyke was Born in the United States of America</strong></h2><p>Mary Carey Van Dyke describes herself as a famous mother and daughter-in-law. She was born and raised in the United States of America, and by this virtue, she is an American citizen and belongs to the Caucasian ethnic group. She has blonde hair and black eyes. Information about Mary’s date and year of birth is not recorded. However, it is presumable that she would currently be in her middle 60s.</p><p>Also, there are no records of her educational background and qualifications. The fact that information about Mary’s personal and early life is scarce in the media is understandable because she only came to the limelight following her marriage to Barry. Left for her, she prefers to keep away from the spotlight.</p><h2><strong>Who is Mary Carey Van Dyke’s Husband?</strong></h2><p>Mary Carey Van Dyke’s husband is Barry Van Dyke. He was born in Atlanta, Georgia, on 31st July 1951 and is now 72 years old. Barry Van Dyke is famous for his role as Lieutenant Detective Steve Sloan in the crime drama series Diagnosis Murder. Barry is the second son of the iconic award-winning actor Dick Van Dyke who is currently 98 years old.</p><p>Barry’s acting career started in 1971, following in his father’s footsteps, and today, he has achieved success in the field with a long list of movies and awards to his credit. Some of his successful and popular movies and TV shows include Diagnosis: Murder, 6 Guns, She-Wolf of London, Foxfire Light, The Love Boat, Eight is Enough, The Redd Foxx Show, and many others.</p><p>Meanwhile, in recent years, rumors made rounds on the internet that Barry Van had died. This put a lot of people in confusion, and according to the death hoax, he died in May 2017 from kidney failure. However, this rumor was shortly proven to be a lie though the reason that brought about it was not ascertained. Mary Carey’s husband is very much alive and healthy, going on strong with his career, and his appearances in the media have completely buried the rumor.</p><h2><strong>Mary and Bary Got Married in 1974 and Are Still Together To Date</strong></h2><p>Carey Van Dyke’s parents, Mary Carey and Barry Van Dyke have had a long-lasting marital life. In fact, their marriage is apparently one of the longest-lasting marriages currently in the American entertainment industry, where we have seen many celebrity marriages crumble by the day. Just like every other marriage, they’ve had their fair share of struggles and storms but weathered them and have continued to go on strong.</p><p>The couple reportedly met when they were much younger in 1967 and were together for seven years before tying the knot. They got married in 1974, making their marriage 49 years old today. The couple has lived together happily ever since then and enjoyed marital bliss.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/buzznigeria.com/us/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/06/Mary-Carey-Van-Dyke-and-her-husband-Barry-Van-Dyke-1024x651.jpg><p>Against the rumor that was peddled sometime in 2017 that they had divorced, the couple is still married to date, sustaining a union that spans almost five decades. Indeed, they are a typical example of a couple who have put in their best to ensure their marriage works, regardless of whatever challenge it faces. Mary Carey Van Dyke is said to be very supportive of her husband’s career even though she is not seen attending events with him.</p><h2><strong>Mary is the Mother of Carey Van Dyke and Four Other Children</strong></h2><p>Mary Carey’s and Barry Van Dyke’s 49 year-old marriage is blessed with four children; three sons and one daughter named Carey, Shane, Wesley, and Taryn. Interestingly, all of their four children have followed in their father’s and grandfather’s footsteps in the entertainment industry.</p><p>Carey, who is the first child of the couple, was born on 25th February 1976 and is currently 47 years old. Carey Van Dyke is a movie producer, screenwriter, and actor. He made his acting debut in 1994 and is known for his movies Don’t Worry Darling, The Silence, and Chernobyl Diaries, a film he wrote the script for. Carey first got married to Anne Coolbaugh, and they shared three daughters. Their marriage lasted for about a decade before they separated, and he is currently married to Stephanie Rhodes.</p><p>Mary Carey’s second son, Shane Van Dyke, 44, born on 28th August 1979, is also an actor, screenwriter, and movie director. Among the four of them, Shayne seems to be more popular as an actor, just like his father. He starred alongside his three siblings in Diagnosis: Murder, and his other known movies are Titanic II, The Bold and the Beautiful, Murder 101, Super Shark, etc. Shayne Van Dyke is married to Julie Schreiner, and together they have one child.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/buzznigeria.com/us/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/06/Mary-Careys-four-children.png><p>Mary and her husband Barry welcomed their third son, Wesley on 22nd October 1984. Currently 39 year old, Wesley Van Dyke is an actor and artist known for his role in Titanic II and the popular TV series Diagnosis Murder. He is not married yet and also does not have a child.</p><p>The youngest child and only daughter in the family, Taryn, was born on 1st June 1986 and is now 37 years old. Taryn Van Dyke also takes after her father and has a few acting roles, including in Diagnosis Murder. Although, her primary job at the moment is as a kindergarten teacher. Nothing is known about her personal life as to whether she is married or has children.</p><p>Mary Carey shares an equal cordial relationship with all her four children, including Carey. More than their film careers, Carey, Shane, Wesley, and Taryn are better known as the children and grandchildren of Barry Van Dyke and Dick Van Dyke respectively.</p><h2><strong>Where is Mary Carey Van Dyke Now?</strong></h2><p>Although she has a spot in the limelight over many years of her marriage to Barry, there is still no available record of Mary Carey’s profession or career path. It seems the celebrity spouse and mother of four focused only on raising her family and supporting her husband.</p><p>Mary Carey does not have a presence on any social media platform, and that makes it more difficult to find out any reliable information about what she is currently up to. But, we believe that she still lives together with her husband, Barry, in Atlanta, Georgia, United States.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiapa%2FHr7XGnqmimV6YvK571Kxmpp2VqXqurdGyZJyZoprGbsLAp2SdsZuaeqSt0Z6wZq6Ro3qlxcqeqmaln6m1pr6O</p></div><div id=links><a href=./michael-hosinski-ex-indiana-high-school-teacher-who-slapped-student-gets-probation-and-dollar100-fine.html>&#171;&nbsp;Michael Hosinski, Ex Indiana High School Teacher Who Slapped Student, Gets Probation and $100 Fine</a>
