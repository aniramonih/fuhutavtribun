1979, in Norfolk, Virginia USA, and is a retired professional baseball outfielder who spent 15 seasons in Major League Baseball (MLB), playing for the Minnesota Twins (2001-2011), Colorado Rockies (2012-2014), and New York Mets (2015), after which he retired. During his career, Michael was a two time All-Star, and won the Silver Slugger Award in 2013, among other accomplishments.</p><p>Have you ever wondered how rich Michael Cuddyer is, as of mid- 2017? According to authoritative sources, it has been estimated that Cuddyer’s net worth is as high as $35 million, an amount earned largely through his successful career in baseball.</p><h3>Michael Cuddyer Net Worth $35 Million</h3><p>Michael was born to Marcia Harris and Henry Cuddyer, and has a younger sister, Katie. During his childhood years, Michael lost hearing in his left ear due to a virus, but that didn’t stop him from becoming an outstanding athlete and a successful student. He went to Great Bridge High School in Chesapeake, Virginia, where he not only played baseball, but also excelled in other sports, including basketball and football. During his high school career, he received Virginia’s Player of the Year and Gatorade National Baseball Player of the Year awards, both in 1997.</p><p>That same year he was drafted by the Minnesota Twins in an amateur draft as a ninth pick overall; however, he didn’t sign with the club until the Twins raised the bar on his signing bonus from $700,000 to $1.3 million. He made his debut in 1998 for the Fort Wayne Wizards of the single-A Midwest League, but before that he attended Florida State University and played for the Florida Seminoles. Once he became fully focused on professional basketball, Michael gradually improved and progressed through the Twins minor league clubs, and in 2001 made his MLB debut, in the match against the Cleveland Indians. However, he didn’t stay long in the league for the first time as he was soon sent back to AAA Edmonton. In 2002, Michael was again brought to the Major League, but failed to make an impact in Twins’ games. This was the situation until 2004 season, when he was used in the infield as second and third baseman. He made over 100 appearances for the first time in his career, however, his numbers weren’t very impressive, though he had a batting average of .263. He continued the same way in 2005, playing in 126 games and again posted a batting average of .263, but he struggled on third base, which eventually resulted in him being sent to the bench. The 2005 season was also a problematic season for Michael due to lateral meniscus repair surgery. However, for the following season, Michael received a one-year contract extension worth $1.3 million, which certainly increased his net worth, and then after the 2007 season, he received a new contract worth $24 million over three years, increasing his net worth to a large degree.</p><p>After an injury marred 2008 season, Michael returned stronger and better than ever for the 2009 season, in which he hit two home runs in the same inning, which made him the 53rd player in MLB history to achieve such thing. Also, he became the only player to perform both defensive and offensive rarities in the same season in the MLB’s history. This motivated him further, and then in 2011, Michael earned his first All-Star appearance.</p><p>However, the Twins decided not to extend his contract, and he joined the Colorado Rockies on a three-year contract worth $31.5 million, which only increased further his wealth. While at Rockies, Michael played his best baseball, having a 27-game hitting streak, the longest in Rockies history to that point, and finished the 2013 season with a .331 batting average, receiving the NL batting champion award, then his second All-Star appearance, and Silver Slugger Award for being the best offensive player.</p><p>After his contract with the Rockies expired, Michael became a part of the New York Mets franchise, signing a contract worth $21 million, adding further to his net worth. He played only one season for the Mets and had a batting average of .259, before being put on the disabled list, due to a bone bruise in his left knee. While with the Mets, Michael made his first and only World Series, but his team lost to the Kansas City Royals.</p><p>He retired in December 2015, finishing his career with a .277 batting average, 197 home runs and 794 runs batted in. He was subsequently inducted into the Minnesota Twins Hall of Fame.<br>Regarding his personal life, Michael has been married to Claudia Rente since 2006; the couple has three children together.</p>﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿<table class=interesting_facts readability=1.5><tr><th>#</th><th>Fact</th></tr><tr readability=3><td>1</td><td>Selected by the Minnesota Twins 9th overall in the 1997 amateur draft.
