The television star and businesswoman, born in Brooklyn on May 24, 1945, was famously married to </span><a href=#><b>Elvis Presley</b></a><span> but built up an empire of her own too. Keep reading for details on Priscilla’s net worth and how she makes money.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p><h2>What Is Priscilla Presley’s Net Worth?</h2><p><span>The former chairwoman of Elvis Presley Enterprises has an estimated net worth of $50 million, according to </span><a href=#><span>Celebrity Net Worth</span></a><span>. Priscilla was married to the hitmaker from 1967 until 1973. She gave birth to the rock ‘n’ roll legend’s only child, daughter </span><a href=#><b>Lisa Marie Presley</b></a><span>, on February 1, 1968.&nbsp;<span class=x_ContentPasted7>Sadly, Lisa Marie <a href=#>died</a> on January 12, 2023, at the age of 54 after <a href=#>suffering cardiac arrest</a></span><span class=x_ContentPasted7>.&nbsp;</span></span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.closerweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/lisa-marie-presley-priscilla-presley.jpg><p><span>About two decades later — on March 1, 1987, to be exact — she gave birth to her son, </span><a href=#><b>Navarone Garibaldi</b></a>, <span>with her then-partner, </span><b>Marco Garibaldi</b><span>. Both <a href=#>Navarone and Lisa Marie</a> have established music careers of their own. Priscilla’s daughter had her own <a href=#>whopping net worth</a> estimated to be around $16 million at the time of her death.</span></p><h2>How Does Priscilla Presley Make Money?</h2><p><span>The year she split from Elvis, Priscilla launched a boutique clothing store in Los Angeles called Bis & Beau. The store closed its doors in 1976, one year before Elvis’ tragic death. It was up to her to act as executor for the “Can’t Help Falling in Love” singer’s sole heir, Lisa Marie. The upkeep of Graceland — Elvis’ mansion — proved to be a burden, but she ultimately turned the residence into one of the top tourist attractions in the United States. Priscilla formed Elvis Presley Enterprises in 1979 and served as its chairwoman and president for years.</span></p><p><span>Another reason for Priscilla’s impressive bank account is the fact that she has been in some </span><a href=#><span>memorable TV shows and movies</span></a><span>. On the small screen, she is known for playing Jenna Wade for 133 episodes of </span><i><span>Dallas</span></i><span> in a supporting role in seasons 2, 3 and 7. She played the main role between seasons 8 and 11. On the big screen, it was her role of Jane Spencer in the hilarious </span><i><span>The Naked Gun</span></i><span> franchise that earned her acclaim across all three films in the iconic trilogy.</span></p><p><span>While these roles in her past — her last IMDb credit is from 2019 — Priscilla is hopeful there will be a comeback in her future but is also not in a rush to jump at just any project that comes her way.</span></p><p><span>“She always daydreams about getting a fun small role on a great show, like </span><a href=#><i><span>Big Little Lies</span></i></a><span>, which she loves,” a source close to the exclusively told </span><a href=#><i><span>Closer</span></i> <i><span>Weekly</span></i></a><span> in June 2019. “But she’s not looking to get back in front of the camera. She’s been approached to do some reality shows, but she turns them all down.”</span></p><p><span>It seems as though Priscilla has her sights set on being behind the scenes when it comes to what she wants to do in Hollywood. In August 2019, it was announced that she would be co-creating and co-producing an adult animated series for Netflix called </span><i><span>Agent King</span></i><span>.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>The series is about Elvis’ fictional adventures as a musician by day, spy by night. The first season was set for release in 2022. Priscilla’s involvement in the show led her to reflect on her ex-husband’s legacy during an August 2021 interview with </span><i><span>The Commercial Appeal</span></i><span>.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>“Elvis has brought so many people together,” she said. “He was so caring, so considerate, sensitive, of course – it’s like the fans are like him … because they’ve been gracious, loyal, brought their families and keep coming back. It really is like one big huge family.”</span></p><p><span>Since bursting into Hollywood in the early ‘60s, Priscilla has shown no signs of slowing down. The beauty and her family all voiced their support and offered their praises for </span><b>Baz Luhrmann</b><span>’s biographical musical, </span><i><span>Elvis,</span></i><span> in June 2022. Years prior to the film’s release, Priscilla sat down with the Australian filmmaker and was kept in the loop about the storyline and the cast.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>“I have been involved with Baz,” the </span><i><span>Dallas</span></i><span> alum told </span><a href=#><i><span>Us Weekly</span></i></a><span> in September 2019. “He has come to my home, and he has been emailing me. In fact, we’re going to be having another lunch at my home. He’s keeping me on top of everything. It’s been wonderful. He is a genius.”&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>After watching the film several times before its theatrical release and attending several of its premieres worldwide, Priscilla was thrilled with the final product. During a June 2022 interview with </span><i><span>Good Morning America</span></i><span>, the television personality revealed that she wished her late ex-husband was there to witness the movie magic.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>“I’m sitting there watching this movie and going, ‘God, I wish he could see this,'” she said. “It was perfection.”</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLjOrJyrr5WauK3FjZympmegpMC1v46pqaKrk565ra2Mqameq5yaxm66xK1ksKeiqbVw</p></div><div id=links><a href=./ray-gunkel.html>&#171;&nbsp;Ray Gunkel</a>
