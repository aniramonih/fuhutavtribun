He is also known for playing chord-based harmonics on the bass, and for using the slap bass technique to produce percussive sounds through his instrument.

He has also played Fernandes Gravity 5-string basses. Before joining Metallica, Trujillo played 5-string Tobias, MusicMan, and ESP basses.

In 2010, Trujillo collaborated with Dunlop Manufacturing to create new signature bass strings that use taper-core stainless steel.</p><h2 id=personal-life><strong>Personal Life</strong></h2><p>With his wife Chloé, Trujillo has a son named Tye and a daughter named Lullah.
