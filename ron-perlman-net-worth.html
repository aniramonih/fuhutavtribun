"Ron" Perlman on April 13, 1950 to Jewish parents in Washington Heights, New York, New York. Even though he was not considered traditionally handsome, Perlman became really popular in high school theater thanks to his height (6-foot-2) and his deep, rolling voice. Perlman graduated from George Washington High School in 1967. He continued mastering the acting craft at Lehman College and later at the University of Minnesota, where he graduated with a master's degree in theater arts in 1973.</p><h2 id=film-television-career><strong>Film and Television Career</strong></h2><p>After college he worked with New York's Classic Stage Company, an organization specializing in Elizabethan and Restoration plays, and performed in several feature movies.

Perlman offered his likeness and voice in 2016's "Call of Duty: Black Ops III" to one of the lead characters in the game's popular Zombies mode–an ex-boxer whose "desperate acts of violence to maintain prominence lead to imprisonment in a pocket dimension infested with hellacious creatures and lovecraftian horror themes."</p><h2 id=personal-life><strong>Personal Life</strong></h2><p>Perlman married his first wife, a jewelry designer named Opal, on February 14, 1981. Unfortunately, they separated in May 2019 and later divorced. The pair had two children together, Blake Amanda Perlman (b. 1984) and Brandon Avery Perlman (b. 1987).
