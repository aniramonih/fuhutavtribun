The singer/songwriter, who prefers they/them pronouns, had a 50-pound weight loss in 2016, but they have since developed a positive gym habit and appear to be gaining weight in their new song.</p><p><a href=# rel=noopener>Samuel Frederick Smith</a>&nbsp;is a well-known British&nbsp;<a href=# rel=noopener>singer</a>&nbsp;and songwriter. They rose to prominence in October 2012, when they contributed to Disclosure’s chart-topping single&nbsp;Latch,&nbsp;which peaked at number eleven on the UK Singles Chart. In May 2013, they contributed to Naughty Boy’s number-one single&nbsp;La La La.&nbsp;And, Smith won both the 2014 Brit Critics’ Choice Award and the BBC’s Sound of 2014 poll in December 2013.</p><p>The English singer was born on May 19, 1992, in London to&nbsp;Frederick Smith&nbsp;and broker&nbsp;Kate Cassidy. They were raised in Great Chishill, Cambridgeshire, and attended the local Thomas More Primary School. They had previously performed in jazz bands before embarking on a career in musical theater.</p><p>Smith attended Bishop’s Stortford’s St Mary’s Catholic School, was a member of the Bishop’s Stortford Junior Operatics, now known as the Bishop’s Stortford Musical Theatre Society, and studied singing and composition with jazz pianist&nbsp;Joanna Eden&nbsp;for several years.</p><p>While changing Sam’s relationship with food was critical to their initial weight loss, they have since developed a positive gym habit and appear to be gaining weight. When compared to previous photos & their most recent song, they look significantly different now. Follow this article to find out if the British singer has gained weight in Unholy.</p><h2>Sam Smith’s Weight Gain in Unholy: What Do the Before and After Photos Suggest in 2022?</h2><p>Sam Smith&nbsp;(<a href=# rel=noopener>@samsmith</a>) admitted to struggling with their weight gain since they were a child, and was even teased at school for being chubby. Sam was chubby as a child, and it got worse and worse until they were carrying a lot of weight in their chest.</p><p>They were so self-conscious that it affected their mood on a daily basis. Changing Sam’s relationship with food was critical to their initial weight loss in 2016, but they have since developed a positive gym habit and appear to be gaining weight. Their before and&nbsp;<a href=# rel=noopener>after photos</a>&nbsp;show significant differences.</p><p>Sam Smith is 6′ 2″ tall and weighs approximately&nbsp;203 lbs.&nbsp;They identify as non-binary and have requested to be addressed with they/them pronouns. With their smash hit&nbsp;Unholy,&nbsp;Smith and&nbsp;Kim Petras&nbsp;have been dominating the charts, all while Sam seems to have a significant weight gain in their new video.</p><p>During their childhood, the Unholy hitmaker had gone to the doctor when they were 11. Sam Smith’s self-consciousness about their weight gain was affecting their mood on a daily basis. They had&nbsp;<a href=# rel=noopener>liposuction</a>&nbsp;at 12.</p><p>The singer decided to talk about their physical insecurities because men rarely discuss their body image. Smith was very pleased with the time, but it didn’t make much of a difference. They gained the weight back in two weeks because they hadn’t figured out their relationship with food, so it didn’t make a difference. However, being 12 years old and having liposuction is a big deal. On the other hand, Smith insists that they still struggle with body image.</p><p>Meanwhile, the 30-year-old British singer is quickly becoming the celebrity poster boy for body acceptance. They’re using their public profile to raise awareness about body image. For them, the Christmas holiday season triggers weight gain, and they want those who feel the same way to understand that it’s important to be kind to your body rather than beating yourself up over an extra serving of mince pies, turkey, and pudding.</p><p>It’s unclear how much they’ve gained weight as a result of their new eating and exercise habits. But they look drastically different now than in&nbsp;<a href=# rel=noopener>previous photos</a>.</p><h2>Sam Smith Previously Lost 50 Pounds While on Paleo, a Low-Carb Diet!</h2><p>Fans were&nbsp;<a href=# rel=noopener>quick to point</a>&nbsp;out British singer&nbsp;Sam Smith’s&nbsp;significant weight loss when they won the Oscar for best original song for&nbsp;Writing’s on the Wall,&nbsp;from the 2015&nbsp;James Bond&nbsp;film&nbsp;Spectre.</p><p>Smith revealed how they lost weight to reporters on the red carpet. They simply ceased eating like a horse. They have stopped eating as much and prefer to be sensible and exercise. On the other hand, Smith combined working out with a low-carb diet.</p><p>The&nbsp;Latch&nbsp;singer revealed that they lost&nbsp;50 pounds&nbsp;while on a paleo, low-carb diet and that they lost&nbsp;14 pounds&nbsp;in 14 days in March. Smith attributes their weight loss to&nbsp;Amelia Freer, the author of&nbsp;Eat. Nourish. Glow&nbsp;and a proponent of a gluten-free Paleo-style diet.</p><p>This diet encourages the consumption of organic eggs, chicken, vegetables, and other proteins while avoiding alcohol. In 2017, Sam Smith stated that weight training and completely eliminating gluten, dairy, and refined sugar from their diet were critical to their weight loss.</p><p>Amelia Freer,&nbsp;Smith’s friend, assisted them in losing over a stone in two weeks and completely transforming their relationship with food. They started doing yoga and snacking on herb-infused ice cubes. They frequently post photos of their nutritious meals and workout sessions to Instagram.</p><p>Furthermore, the 30-year-old songwriter works with a personal trainer thrice a week, alternating between weightlifting and cardio. While changing Sam’s relationship with food was critical to their initial weight loss, they have since developed a positive gym habit, and appear to be gaining weight.</p><h2>Sam Smith’s INSANE Body Transformation</h2><h4>2003: Most kids look terrified to be going to primary school… not Sam!</h4><p>The ‘Writing’s On The Wall’ singer looked REALLY happy to be at primary school back in 2003.
