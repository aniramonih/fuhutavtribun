Rogen and Miller were wed by a female rabbi as guests including <a href=#><strong>Judd Apatow</strong></a> and <a href=#><strong>Leslie Mann</strong></a> celebrated with the happy couple.</p><h3>2012</h3><p>After Miller’s mother was diagnosed with early on-set Alzheimer’s, Miller and Rogen <a href=#>founded their nonprofit organization</a>, Hilarity for Charity. (Miller’s mom passed away in 2020 at age 55.)</p><p>“It’s given meaning and purpose to huge loss in my life. I personally have gotten so much out of the fortunate opportunity that we had to help other people, which has, in turn, helped me process the loss that my family went through with my mom having this terrible disease,” Miller exclusively told Us in March 2022. “So it’s really a very large feeling of what it means to us. And it’s really something that ranges from insane joy to just lots of tears of, ‘I can’t believe that we’ve gotten to do this stuff.’”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Seth-Rogen-and-Wife-Lauren-Miller-Relationship-Timeline-3.jpg><h3>2018</h3><p>Rogen told Us that he was so happy with his wife that <a href=#>he’d be down to renew their vows</a>. “Sure, I’d have another wedding.

I can’t believe I’ve been lucky enough to find the perfect partner to go through life with.

Some people don’t want kids,” he explained on “The Diary of a CEO” podcast. “Honestly, you just are told, you go through life, you get married, you have kids. That’s what happens. And me and my wife, neither of us were like that. Honestly, the older we get, the more happy and reaffirmed we are with our choice to not have kids.”</p><p>He continued: “We are in the prime of our lives. We are smarter than we’ve ever been, we understand ourselves more than we ever have, we have the capacity to achieve a level of work and a level of communication and care for one another, and a lifestyle we can live with one another, that we’ve never been able to live before.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGasnaSderO7xp6lZpmemXq4tcWeZKWZpaeyr3nMoqOlnaKoerOxy5qroqeeqLWqvIytoKadnJ67pns%3D</p></div><div id=links><a href=./seve-ballesteros-height-weight-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-nationality-biography-165012-html.html>&#171;&nbsp;Seve Ballesteros Height, Weight, Net Worth, Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Nationality, Biography</a>
