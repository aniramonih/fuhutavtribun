This dude was one of a kind, and always ready for fun! Irreplaceable soul, and was as close as to a brother that a friend could be for many years. Tomorrows never promised so if you got a friend that you haven’t heard from in a while, don’t hesitate to check in and see how life’s treating them, one day it’ll be to late and you’ll wish you could!
