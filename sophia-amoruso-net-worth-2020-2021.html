world, for a large number of years, had businesses which were run by a majority of men. Women were suppressed and oppressed due to the burden of handling a family on their own. The shadow of patriarchy loomed large on the women of the world. Only recently has the advancement of feminism helped women to understand their true worth, and take action.</p><p>Their abilities in certain fields have proved them not just to match men’s abilities, but also to overtake them. A proper example of such a woman is <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">Sophia Amoruso</a>.</p><p>Maybe you know about Sophia Amoruso very well But do you know how old and tall is she and what is her net worth in 2024? If you do not know, We have prepared this article about details of Sophia Amoruso’s short biography-wiki, career, professional life, personal life, today’s net worth, age, height, weight, and more facts. Well, if you’re ready, let’s start.</p><h2>Early Life</h2><p><a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">Sophia Amoruso</a> is a native of California, United States of America. She was born during the year 1984 and has mixed European ancestry. She has a Greek, Portuguese and Italian heritage in her bloodline. Her religious views stem from the time she spent in the orthodox church, following Greek culture. From her teenage years, she was depressed and became a patient of attention deficiency and hyperactivity, a condition commonly known as ADHD.</p><p>Due to these reasons, she stopped attending classes at her regular school and decided to go for homeschooling instead. She went through different odd jobs in order to procure extra money, working at Subway and record shops. After she finished high school, her family was divided as her parents had gone through a divorce. Sophia then moved to another city in California, called Sacramento.</p><p>At this point, Sophia had become a bit of a rebel, often leading a lifestyle similar to that of a nomad. She hitchhiked and even engaged in acts of thieving and stealing. At Oregon, she was detained for her thievery and had decided never to behave this way again. After this incident, she moved to another city, called San Francisco, and had to purchase medical insurance. This was due to the fact that she had to diagnose a hernia which was in her groin. She decided to attend community college, and do an odd job on the side.</p><h2>Personal Life</h2><p>In 2014, Sophia Amoruso and Jarek DeGraff tied the wedding knot and became each other’s lawful husband and wife. Sophia met Joel Jarek DeGraff back in 2002. Although they didn’t start dating immediately.</p><p>Unfortunately, their relationship could not handle the stress of being married. And, as a surprise, her husband asked for a divorce quoting they weren’t right for each other. As a result, Sophia divorced Joel Jarek DeGraff in August 2016.</p><h2>Age, Height, and Weight</h2><p>Being born on April 20, 1984, Sophia Amoruso is 40 years old as of today’s date 20th July 2024. Her height is 1.68 m tall, and weight is 58 kg.</p><h2>Career</h2><p>When Sophia was 22 years old, she was making money as a security guard. It was at this time that she decided to open an eBay store, which would be in an online format. She called the store Nasty Gal Vintage. The store was named after an album by the iconic singer called Betty Davis. Vintage clothing was slowly catching up amongst the new generation, and she took this opportunity to collect used retro clothing and sell it at a profit.</p><p>Everything, from the packaging to the photography, was done by Sophia at the very beginning. Later on, Amoruso said that she had been <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">banned by eBay</a>, due to the fact that she had provided hyperlinks to her actual store website, in which customers were to provide feedback. Her popularity, along with that of her company, grew to a great extent. However, in 2015, Nasty Gal Vintage had filed for bankruptcy. Sophia herself had stepped down from her position as the chairwoman.</p><h2>Awards and Achievements</h2><p>Sophia Amoruso was titled as the “Cinderella of tech” by the prestigious New York Times. Her company grew from nothing to be worth around $23 million by the end of 2011. She has even published her very own <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">autobiography</a> by the name of #GIRLBOSS. This signifies her victory over patriarchal notions of women.</p><h2>Net Worth & Salary of Sophia Amoruso in 2024</h2><p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.wealthypersons.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Sophia-Amoruso-Net-Worth.jpg alt="Sophia Amoruso Net Worth 2019" width=875 height=544 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center>As of July 2024, Sophia Amoruso is currently worth about $5 million.
