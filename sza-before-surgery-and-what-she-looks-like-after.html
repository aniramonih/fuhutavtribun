And, based on the lyrics from her second album, the singer seems to confirm having undergone some plastic surgery procedures. Yet, she has not directly spoken about it.</strong></p><p>SZA, whose real name is Sol√°na Imani Rowe, is a 34-year old American singer-songwriter. She had her breakthrough in the music industry with her debut album, Ctrl, which was declared the best album of the year by Time. Since then, she has been gaining the attention of the media in every aspect of her life. Meanwhile, after the release of her debut album, it was noticed that there were differences in her appearance. Here‚Äôs the truth you need to know about the singer‚Äôs plastic surgery rumors.</p><h2><strong>Did SZA Get BBL Plastic Surgery?</strong></h2><p>It is not known for sure if SZA got BBL plastic surgery because she has not confirmed it. After she released her debut album, Ctrl, in 2017, rumors started making rounds that SZA had undergone plastic surgery. These rumors were intensified following the lyrics of one of her songs, ‚ÄúConceited, I just got my body done, ain‚Äôt got no guilt about it / I just heard your opinion, I could‚Äôve did without it. Many people seem to be very certain of this after comparing her before and after pictures. According to their findings, SZA‚Äôs nose looks straighter and her chin appears to be longer.</p><p>Not only that, but the singer no longer look as big as she used to be. While some believes her nose and chin look different because of makeup or weight loss, a larger percentage of her fans strongly believe that she certainly had some work done on her face, as the change was too significant to be just a result of weight loss or perfect makeup. Furthermore, a Reddit user went on to point out that SZA also had a brow lift.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/buzznigeria.com/us/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/09/SZA-before-and-after-surgery.png><p>Judging by the picture above, this point is true. Another user on the platform also pointed out that she has ditched her ‚Äúfake freckles.‚Äù While some complimented her new look, especially her nose, some others were all for criticisms, with the claims that she was perfect the way she was and needed no plastic surgery.</p><h2><strong>SZA Before and After BBL Plastic Surgery</strong></h2><p>Some of the observations and comments her fans on Reddit made about her old and new looks include; ‚ÄúShe looks better before to me, ‚Ä¶now she looks a bit plasticky and has this canned look‚Äù, ‚ÄúHer body is amazing, a perfect balance between thick and slim, she should never have touched her skin, her before shape was really cute, now her face is verging into the uncanny territory.‚Äù</p><p>Another Redditor went on to state that SZA is very beautiful but that he wishes she had just subtly enhanced her natural features instead of getting a new nose and chin. However, the singer has chosen to keep silent over these comments and opinions and not react or respond to any.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/buzznigeria.com/us/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/09/before-and-after-bbl.png><p>From all indications, SZA appears to be very confident and happy with her new look and feels like she owes no one any explanation whatsoever. Meanwhile, it is interesting to state that whether or not she underwent cosmetic surgery or any work on her body at all, SZA has continued to flourish in her music career, dropping hits back to back and her fans have also continued to declare their support for her.</p><h2><strong>Did SZA Lose Weight?</strong></h2><p>Yes, SZA lost weight. Away from the rumors about her undergoing surgery, the Hit Different singer has been open about her weight loss journey and sticking to a healthy lifestyle. According to her, she initially weighed 200 pounds, which made her prefer dressing in baggy clothes to hide her weight.
