His mother was a teacher and his father a producer at the BBC. The 45-year-old studied acting at the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art (RADA), however, he didn't always want to be an actor. In a previous chat with Interview magazine, Tobias revealed that when he was a child he used to play tennis competitively and wanted to become a professional player. "That was what I was nuts about, what I used to dream about," he said. "The brutal truth was I probably wasn't quite good enough."</p><p id=ekWjaN1fVwTI data-wc=66>It wasn't until he attended RADA that he eventually caught the acting bug after initially enrolling to study theatre production and dance. "When I got to RADA, I was surrounded by a lot of people who had wanted to be actors since they were yay high and by the time I left, I'd really caught the bug for acting, the bug for straight performance," he added.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/8c77778ab423-the-crown-tobias-menzies-z.jpg><p id=er-2AxLIChYj data-wc=9><strong>Tobias stars opposite Olivia Colman and Helena Bonham Carter</strong></p><h2>Which TV shows has Tobias Menzies been in?</h2><p id=e7GI96ZerQIS data-wc=97>Tobias' first job out of drama school was on BBC One medical drama Casualty. He has also appeared on Foyle's War, Midsomer Murders, The Night Manager, The Terror,&nbsp;and Channel 4 sitcoms Catastrophe and This Way Up. He received a Golden Globe nomination in 2015 and 2016 for his dual role as Frank Randall and Jonathan "Black Jack" Randall in Outlander. He is perhaps best known for his work on <strong><a class=hm-link href=#>Game Of Thrones</a>,</strong> which he starred in from 2013 to 2016.

He was previously in a relationship with actress Kristin Scott Thomas between 2005 and 2006, however, their romance sparked some controversy. The former couple were rumoured to have started a relationship while Kristin was still married to François Olivennes, which reportedly is the reason behind their split and eventual divorce after seventeen years together.</p><p id=e4GyTupClGdU data-wc=1><strong>MORE:&nbsp;<a class=hm-link href=#>The Crown season three review: Meet your new Queen&nbsp;</a></strong></p><h2>What has Tobias Menzies said about his role in The Crown?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/e30165444e62-the-crown-tobias-menzies-olivia-colman-z.jpg><p id=eZqHMGWHQwuH data-wc=10><strong>Tobias plays Prince Philip while Olivia Colman portrays The Queen</strong></p><p id=eB1QLLwNci3M data-wc=93>Tobias will star as <a class=hm-link href=#>Prince Philip</a> in both season three and season four of The Crown after taking over the role from Matt Smith. Speaking about how he prepared for the role, he previously told the Evening Standard that he did look to past seasons to pick up on Matt's "mannerisms and intonation", but mainly utilised archive footage of the Duke of Edinburgh to prepare. "He was less mannered when he was younger, much less of a Spitting Image puppet," he said. "In the Nineties and 2000s he became a more extreme version of himself."</p><h2>When does The Crown season three air?</h2><p id=etot74_zzvfm data-wc=20>You can watch every episode of season three of The Crown on Sunday 17 November when it drops on Netflix.</p><p id=eTb6CPVg8oXQ data-wc=14><strong>Like this story?<a class=hm-link href=#> Sign up to our newsletter</a> to get other stories like this delivered straight to your inbox.</strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbHLpaammZeWx6q6xGeaqKVfm7atuY5rZ2pxYWZ%2BdoSPbnBxZ6Sdsm6v0aiup2WkpK%2BqrdJmpJ6mqp6ytHnEr5yrsaSdtq%2BzjLKmrmWemrKledOoZKSmn6x8</p></div><div id=links><a href=./jose-benavidez-jr-s-girlfriend-list.html>Who is Jose Benavidez Jr. Dating Jose Benavidez Jr.'s Girlfriend &amp;amp; Exes&nbsp;&#187;</a></div></section><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
