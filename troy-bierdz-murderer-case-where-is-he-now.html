Two years later, he led the police on a high-speed pursuit and cut his arms upon being caught.</p><p>He was subsequently admitted to a psych ward, where he threatened to kill a nurse and talked about killing his brother, Thom, and experiencing what it would feel like to kill someone.</p><p>Although Troy was ultimately diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia, it was too late, and he murdered his mother, Phyllis Bierdz, just months after she reported his threatening behavior to the police.</p><p>After killing Phyllis, Troy fled in her car with her purse, painting the car black and stealing number plates from another vehicle.</p><p>He even pawned items found in the trunk to pay for gas and impersonated his brother, Thom, in a 911 call, admitting to killing Phyllis and raping Troy.</p><p>Eventually, the authorities arrested him in Laredo, Texas, and Troy tried to burn off his fingerprints to avoid identification.</p><p>After confessing to the murder, Troy was found guilty and sentenced to life in prison.

Although he has forgiven Troy, he acknowledges that his mother’s murder had a profound impact on his life.</p><p>Troy Bierdz’s troubled childhood and mental health issues ultimately led to him murdering his mother, Phyllis Bierdz.</p><p>He remains incarcerated at Columbia Correctional Institution in Portage, Wisconsin, and will be eligible for parole in 2039.</p><p>In contrast, Thom Bierdz pursued a successful career in Hollywood and shifted his interests to painting and writing.</p><p>Although he was devastated by his mother’s murder, he has forgiven his brother and advocates for his mental health treatment.</p><span class="tve-leads-two-step-trigger tl-2step-trigger-0"></span><span class="tve-leads-two-step-trigger tl-2step-trigger-0"></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7t7XZmpqaZpOkunDA0aiwZpqZmr%2BlxoymrKuclaeys3nCmqqeZaedsrOxjKKqZqCVYruww44%3D</p></div><div id=links><a href=./vanessa-lee-chester.html>&#171;&nbsp;Vanessa Lee Chester- Wiki, Age, Height, Net Worth, Boyfriend, Ethnicity</a>
