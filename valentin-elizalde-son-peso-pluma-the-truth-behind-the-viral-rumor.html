His stage name translates to “Featherweight” in English, and he is known for his unique style of singing corridos, a genre of Mexican folk music that narrates stories of love, betrayal, violence, and heroism.</p><p>Peso Pluma has gained millions of followers and fans across social media platforms, and has performed at prestigious events such as the MTV VMAs. He has also collaborated with other popular artists such as Natanael Cano, Junior H, and Grupo Firme.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Why is he compared to Valentin Elizalde?</h2><p>One of the reasons why Peso Pluma has attracted so much attention is his striking resemblance to Valentin Elizalde, a legendary Mexican singer who was nicknamed “El Gallo de Oro” (The Golden Rooster). Valentin Elizalde was one of the most successful and influential artists of the regional Mexican music scene, and was especially famous for his corridos and romantic ballads.</p><p>However, his life and career were cut short when he was assassinated in November 2006, allegedly by a drug trafficking Mexican gang or cartel. He was only 27 years old when he died, leaving behind a legacy of music and a loyal fan base.</p><p>Many people have noticed the similarities between Peso Pluma and Valentin Elizalde, not only in their physical appearance, but also in their voice, their musical genre, and their charisma. Some have even speculated that Peso Pluma is the reincarnation of Valentin Elizalde, or that he is his secret son.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Is Peso Pluma related to Valentin Elizalde?</h2><p>The answer is no. Peso Pluma is not Valentin Elizalde’s son, nor is he his reincarnation. They are not related by blood, and they were born in different places and times. Peso Pluma is from Jalisco, while Valentin Elizalde was from Sonora.</p><p>Peso Pluma has denied any family ties with Valentin Elizalde, and has clarified that the only connection he has with him is his admiration and influence. He has said that he grew up listening to Valentin Elizalde’s music, and that he considers him one of his idols and inspirations.</p><p>Peso Pluma has also expressed his respect and gratitude for Valentin Elizalde’s fans, who have welcomed him and supported him in his musical career. He has said that he hopes to honor Valentin Elizalde’s memory and legacy with his own songs and style.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>What is the source of the rumor?</h2><p>The rumor that Peso Pluma is Valentin Elizalde’s son started when someone at a press conference asked him if he might be the reincarnation of Elizalde. The question was based on the uncanny resemblance between the two singers, and the fact that Peso Pluma was born a few months after Valentin Elizalde’s death.</p><p>The rumor gained more traction when a TikTok video was shared that claimed that Peso Pluma is actually the son of former Mexican actress Adela Noriega and ex-Mexican President Carlos Salinas de Gortari. The video showed an old photo of the actress and the former president, with a toddler between them, who was alleged to be Peso Pluma.</p><p>However, there is no evidence to support this claim, and it has been dismissed as a hoax and a conspiracy theory. Peso Pluma has not commented on this video, but he has previously stated that his father is from Jalisco, and that he has appeared in some of his TikTok videos.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>What are the consequences of the rumor?</h2><p>The rumor that Peso Pluma is Valentin Elizalde’s son or reincarnation has not only generated curiosity and controversy, but also danger and fear. Peso Pluma has received death threats from unknown sources, who have left banners across the city of Tijuana, where he was scheduled to perform on October 14, 2023.</p><p>The death threats have forced Peso Pluma to cancel his concert, and to take security measures to protect himself and his team. The motives behind the threats are unclear, but some have suggested that they are related to the TikTok video that linked him to Adela Noriega and Carlos Salinas de Gortari, or to the rivalry and violence that surrounds the corrido genre and the drug cartels.</p><p>Peso Pluma’s fans and supporters have expressed their concern and outrage over the threats, and have demanded justice and protection for the singer. They have also shown their solidarity and love for Peso Pluma, and have encouraged him to continue with his music and his dreams.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmibkaeypr7GnpirZpiau7CyjZympmeemsS0e9KtpquxX6uurbHNraCnZZWhtruty52cZqufo3qxsdKoZKmkpaKubsDHnmStqqWptW6uxKGgp5xdqbWmedWiqZqkXafCrrvRaA%3D%3D</p></div><div id=links><a href=./verena-lafferentz-wagners-grand-daughter-close-hitler-married.html>&#171;&nbsp;Verena Lafferentz, Wagners grand-daughter, who was close to Hitler and married a Nazi obituar</a>
