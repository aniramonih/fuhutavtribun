Dominican descent and a Trinidadian mother.&nbsp;Carolina was raised alongside her older sister, Cardi B, in Highbridge, a predominantly Latino neighborhood in New York’s South Bronx.</span></p><p><span>She was named after her father’s favorite drink after he showed up drunk when she was born.&nbsp;The unusual name, in turn, inspired her sister’s nickname, Bacardi, which eventually became her professional name, Cardi B. The 5’1″ beauty has been captivated by the arts since childhood and has attended art and acting schools to cultivate her talent, she also noticed that her teachers made her for the camera and television and gave her nods for her artistic abilities and fashion styles ( even as a child in elementary schools, she wore heels to school.) She also harbored the dream of becoming a fashion designer growing up.</span></p><p><span>Hennessy attended Renaissance High School during Musical Theater & Technology, a small vocational high school located on the campus of Herbert H. Lehman High School.&nbsp;She’s known for her styles that accentuate her slim figure as she effortlessly transitions from missed chic to red carpet, ready faster than you think.&nbsp;Whether she’s mixing and matching high-waisted pants, heeled ankle boots and vintage berets, she’s always got the It Fashion Girl look.</span></p><p><span>Her sister may be firmly rooted in rap Hennessy is set to lead the way in the fashion industry.&nbsp;Plans are in place to create her own fashion line which is expected to launch in 2019. Additionally, she is pursuing a career as a stylist and designer at the Fashion Institute of Technology.&nbsp;The rising fashionista is also very interested.&nbsp;She plans to dress all the celebrities on the red carpet.</span></p><p><span>Although she made her television debut when she appeared on VH1’s Love & Hip Hop, realizing her teacher’s prediction about her, she overcame the nervousness she had felt after that time to return to acting. ‘screen.&nbsp;Hennessy Carolina appeared on the third season of the game show The Challenge: Champs vs.&nbsp;stars.&nbsp;The show features contestants who engage in athletic challenges to raise funds for the contestant’s chosen charity, which intrigued Carolina to sign up for the Challenge.&nbsp;The cast includes Drake Bell, Selita Ebanks, Louise Hazel, Arian Foster, among others.&nbsp;She chose BronxWorks as a charity to honor her hometown.&nbsp;She only spent three episodes of the series.</span></p><p><span>The pretty lady likely prioritized her early career in fashion design over television opportunities.&nbsp;Also, she is building an Instagram empire with 3.7 million followers, which is a testament to her growing popularity.</span></p><h2><strong><span>Net value</span></strong></h2><p><span>Hennessy has firmly established herself in the celebrity scene and as such, she receives the dividends that come with status.&nbsp;Apart from fame, she also boasts of a healthy bank account that keeps growing.&nbsp;His net worth is estimated at $250,000.</span></p><h2><strong><span>Girlfriend</span></strong></h2><p><span>She came out as bisexual in 2017. Although it was known that she had dated several men in the past, the question of who her new love interest was went unanswered for some time.&nbsp;Eventually, his identity was revealed.&nbsp;Hennessy Carolina has been dating Michelle Diaz, whom she met on Instagram since 2017. She swooned over her beautiful outfit and bone structure and so got in touch with her.&nbsp;Although she hinted that she always imagined her future with a man, she couldn’t be happier in a same-sex relationship.&nbsp;Her sister also praised her sister’s openness to her guidance on Twitter.</span></p><p><span>While she’s seemingly on cloud nine with her girlfriend, it wasn’t easy for her to have her family, especially her mother, by her side.&nbsp;Starting from the fact that his mother is from the Caribbean, where people are mostly homophobic, getting him to accept his new status was a bit difficult to pin down.&nbsp;She then taught her family that she doesn’t need to do certain things, that’s what other people or even society expects of her.&nbsp;Eventually they learned to accept him and his version of how life works.&nbsp;In turn, she feels free and spreads her message: love is love, regardless of gender, as much as she can.</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGiZrrKqZL2mu8%2BlnGivmKR6qr%2BMoZynppWowLp5wpqpqKSZo65ur8Crm6Jlkqh6tLXSrZyrZZeev62y0aKcp5xdlrSmec2eq2avn6fBqXs%3D</p></div><div id=links><a href=./who-is-jeremy-riddle-dating.html>&#171;&nbsp;Who is Jeremy Riddle Dating Now</a>
