She was born and raised there by her family. Unfortunately, there is no available information about her birth details, which is why her exact age is not publicly known.</p><p>The names of her parents and family members and information about her background, childhood, educational attainments, and life before fame are also difficult to come by. However, we can establish that she completed her basic educational levels in South Africa.</p><h2><strong>The Truth about Nicole Maleka and Kabza De Small’s Breakup</strong></h2><p>When rumors of Nicole Maleka and Kabza De Small’s breakup first surfaced, the internet was in shock, and many people questioned why the happy couple decided to call it quits.</p><p><img decoding=async fetchpriority=high src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/buzzsouthafrica.com/wp-content/uploads/kab-e1678176880766.jpg alt="Who Is Kabza De Small’s Ex-girlfriend Nicole Maleka?" width=696 height=416 sizes="(max-width: 696px) 100vw, 696px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>After months of dating, Kabza and the socialite split up. It is unknown exactly when they first met, how and when their relationship began, or why they actually broke up.</p><p>The Amapiano star’s busy commitments may have contributed to their breakup even though they had a lot of chemistry. When Maleka and Kabza De Small first met, they became friends. After that, they started dating and started appearing in public. They even went to a few events together but were not quite open about their relationship vocally.</p><p>The former lovers, however, had reputations for flooding their respective social media account with pictures of themselves having fun or just hanging out together.</p><p>While the performer has not yet issued a formal statement regarding the breakup, Nicole recently claimed that she was still dating Kabza De Small when he paid his wife’s lobola.</p><p>Nicole made the shocking revelation during a conversation with YouTubr Queen Lelo on her program, Sip or Spill, adding that she was devastated when she learned of Kabza’s decision to pay for Kamogelo Moropa’s lobola while they were still dating.</p><p>A lot of people believe that the performer’s decision to dump Maleka for Moropa was a clear indication that she [Nicole] was not good enough for Kabza De Small. Meanwhile, Kamogelo has since come out to deny the report that she was leaving Kabeza for paying for her lobola while still dating Nicole.</p><h3><strong>Maleka is a Socialite and Self-acclaimed Model&nbsp;</strong></h3><p>Nicole Maleka is one of the most well-known South African socialites who are well-recognized in the media.

Nicole is also reportedly a model, however, there is no information about her modeling jobs or professional history. She represents DM Skins, an e-commerce luxury skincare company.</p><h2><strong>Where is Kabza De Small’s Ex-girlfriend Now and What is She Up to?</strong></h2><p>Nicole Maleka is still very much alive and well; she is consistently active on Instagram, where she updates her followers on both her daily activities and her opulent lifestyle.</p><p>Although she has yet to confirm or deny the rumor, it is said that she is married. Sometime in May 2022, she changed her name on social media to “Mrs. M,” sparking rumors that she was married. Since we haven’t seen a ring on her finger and she hasn’t confirmed the rumor herself, it’s still difficult to determine whether she is indeed married.</p><p><span class=embed-youtube></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiapa%2FHtLvUrZ%2BanqKesKJ6wqikaK%2BYpHqqv4ykmJuykWKxpnnSppilpKNisrl5xqKppZ6inrKvsIynoJynnJp6rq3LnqKaZw%3D%3D</p></div><div id=links><a href=./who-is-lena-mantler-dating-now-exploring-the-influencers-relationship-status-and-past-romances-html.html>&#171;&nbsp;Who is Lena Mantler Dating Now?
