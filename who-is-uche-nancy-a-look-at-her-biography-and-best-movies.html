She is also an indigene of the state and had her primary and secondary education there before proceeding to a higher institution, possibly in the state as well.</p><p>Not much has been said about Uche Nancy’s family and childhood, but from what we gathered, the actress spent much of her early years with her family, which, of course, includes her parents and siblings. The actual date of birth of Uche Nancy has not been revealed, but reports from various media channels suggest that she is between her late 40s and early 50s and celebrates her birthday on May 2nd of every year.</p><h2><strong>She Began her Career as a Costumier in 2009&nbsp;</strong></h2><p>A costume designer is arguably one of the underappreciated roles in movie making. Nevertheless, their stylistic work in the development of a great movie is undeniable. They contribute to the construction of every movie character we love, enhance the film’s setting and, in some cases, transcend the screen and influence our perception of style in our own lives. Such is the work of Uche Nancy, who has been in the Nigerian film industry for decades.</p><p>Uche Nancy probably began to nurse her passion for acting in her childhood and may have begun making moves to join the industry after her secondary education. However, it is said that she officially became a member of the film-producing family in 2009, which brings her age in the industry to be 14 years.</p><p>She started off as a costume designer and is known for working on movies like World Apart and Girls Cot. These movies were produced in 2004 and 2006, respectively, and they featured stars like <a href=# data-wpel-link=internal>Ini Edo</a>, <a href=# data-wpel-link=internal>Kenneth Okonkwo</a>, <a href=# data-wpel-link=internal>Genvieve Nnaji</a>, <a href=# data-wpel-link=internal>Rita Dominic</a>, and <a href=# data-wpel-link=internal>Uche Jumbo</a>, among others.</p><p>As an actress, Uche Nancy has appeared in a couple of Nollywood movies. Among her many film credits are The Seed,&nbsp;Proof of Life,&nbsp;Gallant Babes, and&nbsp;Fulton Mansion. Her various character roles have seen her share the screen with the likes of Angela Okorie, Mercy Johnson-Okojie, Oma Nnadi, Lawrence Onuzulike, and other top Nollywood stars.</p><h3><strong>Uche Nancy’s Movies and TV Shows</strong></h3><ul><li>The Ungrateful Wife</li><li>Loving Heart</li><li>Smile For Me</li><li>Only Son</li><li>Our Pregnant Wife</li><li>I Am Sorry</li><li>Your Love My Wealth</li></ul><h2><strong>Uche Nancy Became a Producer to Keep Actresses from Being Exploited</strong></h2><p>The exact year Nancy became a movie producer is equally not known, but it is believed that her long years of working with top Nollywood producers may have spurred her interest in that career line. As a producer, she is said to have produced a good number of A-list movies, including Buga in Pounds and Dollars, The Lamb, Best of Enemies, Dirty Diamond, Boss Lady, Not My Queen, and Hot Kingdom.&nbsp;</p><p>Nancy, in an interview with a media tabloid, revealed that aside from having personal love for filmmaking, she chose to become a movie producer in order to help other actresses from being exploited by male producers who are just interested in sex. Sex for roles remains a rising issue in the Nigerian movie industry, with many producers being linked to scandals related to the topic.</p><p>This issue arises when competing roles are undeservedly given to individuals, possibly because they gave in to the sexual gratifications of the producer. Many A-list actresses have related their concern over what they largely refer to &nbsp;as ‘advanced prostitution”</p><p>While the likes of Ini Edo, Tonto Dikeh, and Mercy Johnson are among the many star actresses who have raised concern over the issue, the likes of Kanayo O Kanayo have, on the other hand, refuted such claims and urged the public to disregard them. Meanwhile, Nancy claimed that becoming a producer would encourage young females who are interested in acting to enter the industry without the fear of being harassed by male producers.</p><p>Uche Nancy is the CEO of Uche Nancy production, a production company she established in Asaba., Delta state.&nbsp;&nbsp;Aside from having a successful career in the movie industry, Uche Nancy has also proven herself to be a successful business owner as well.&nbsp; She is said to own a three-production farmhouse and a boutique in the heart of Asaba. She uses her Boutique to do her Nollywood Costume.</p><h3><strong>Movies Uche Nancy Has so far Produced</strong></h3><ul><li>Fulton Mansion</li><li>The Lamb</li><li>Buga in Pounds and Dollars</li><li>Best of Enemies</li><li>Dirty Diamond</li><li>Not My Queen</li><li>The Game,</li><li>Fake it</li><li>The Models</li><li>Hot Kingdom</li><li>Boss Lady</li><li>Deep Water and Son</li><li>Gallant Babes</li><li>Face of betrayal</li><li>Proof Of Life</li></ul><h2><strong>Uche Nanc’s Awards and Nominations</strong></h2><p>For her long years of contributing immensely to the production of great and high-rated movies in the world’s third largest movie industry, Nollywood, Uche Nancy has received massive accolades, nominations, and awards from various organizations relevant to the industry.
