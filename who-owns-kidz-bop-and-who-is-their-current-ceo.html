It releases compilation albums that feature children covering versions of contemporary pop songs and other related media that chart high on the Billboard Hot 100. There has since been a trending question of who actually owns the music company and who its CEO is, and we shall answer them in this article.</p><h2><strong>Who is The Owner of Kidz Bop?</strong></h2><p>As stated, the owner of Kidz Bop is Razor and Tie (RT Industries) co-founders Cliff Chenfeld and Craig Balsam. They established the music group in 2001. RT Industries is an American entertainment company and one of the world’s leading independent music labels that create movie musicals, animated features, biopics, and documentaries.</p><p>Cliff Chenfeld and Craig Balsam are American music executives and businessmen. They both earned their law degree from New York University, where they met. After practicing law for some years, they left their law jobs and founded Razor & Tie in 1990.</p><p>Kidz Bob, which released its very first track on the 9th of October 2001, has today expanded to include merchandise, live touring, music videos, talent completions, and what have you. Moreover, the music company has grown and expanded internationally, including in the United Kingdom, Mexico, Germany, and France.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/buzznigeria.com/us/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/05/jj.png><h2><strong>Who is The CEO of Kidz Bop?</strong></h2><p>The CEO of Kidz Bop is Sasha Junk. She was appointed the president and CEO of the music band in April 2020 and is to report directly to Tom Whalley, Concord’s chief label executive.</p><p>This new appointment came just before Kidz Bop celebrated its 20th birthday. Sasha Junk succeeded Victor Zeraya, the former president of the music band who was raised to the position of Chief Revenue Officer at Concord.</p><p>Sasha Junk graduated from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, where she studied International Relations and Communications Studies. Going by her LinkedIn profile, Sasha previously worked as the Global Head of Publicity at Classical Media, an audio recording service. She worked with the company for six years, from 2001 to 2007.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/buzznigeria.com/us/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/05/Sasha-Junk.png><p>After that, She worked as a managing director at Morris+ King Company for two years, from 2007 to 2009. Sasha also has experience as an SVP of marketing for Kidz Bop for eleven years before she became CEO in April 2020. Under her tenure, Junk has spearheaded several major brand alliances that have allowed Kidz Bop to get to new and larger audiences and partnerships with companies like Mattel, Dollar Car Rental, and Subway.</p><p>Commending Sasha on her impressive leadership skills and contribution toward the rapid growth of Kidz Bop, Whalley said; “There’s no bigger children’s entertainment brand than Kidz Bop, and Sasha’s leadership has been a part of that success.</p><p>Other than this, there is no further information about Junk’s earlier life in the media, as she only became a notable name after the appointment.</p><h2><strong>Is Elise Ecklund the Owner of Kidz Bop?</strong></h2><p>Elise Ecklund is not and has never been the owner or CEO of the popular music brand Kidz Bop. Elise Ecklund is an American YouTuber and social media content creator born on 18th February 1997. She is popular for uploading video music-related content and covers on her YouTube channel and for her skills in playing the ukulele, guitar, and didgeridoo, as well as “learning” kazoo.</p><p>The rumors that Elise is the owner of Kidz Bob started in June 2022 after she uploaded a video of herself doing a search on the internet about who owns Kidz Bop. According to records, the internet search falsely showed that she is the owner, and on 5th June 2020, she took to her Twitter handle with a post that arguably suggests she owns the company;</p><p>“Apparently, I own a multi-million dollar company”. She later came back to say that she is only making a joke about that via the false internet search result. Elise Ecklund does not and has never had any business or work relationship with Kidz Bob. So, the news of her being the CEO or owner of the music brand is worth dismissing.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/buzznigeria.com/us/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/05/Elise.png><p>The internet sensation Elise Ecklund has, moreover, dabbled in some beauty videos and reactions. She is also known for occasionally broadcasting on YouNow. Elise Ecklund is a married woman with two kids. She married her husband, Bryan Landry, on 17th June 2021.</p><h2><strong>What Is Kidz Bop Music Band All About?</strong></h2><p>The music company Kidz Bop has gained immense fame since its establishment in 2001.

Since its debut release in October 2021, Kidz Bop has sold more than 21 million albums and generated over 4.5 billion streams.</p><p>The music company removes adult themes from the music. It is aimed at connecting with kids and families through its music videos and related media content.</p><p>The brand seeks young talents, dancers, and singers who are between the ages of 9 to 12 years.
