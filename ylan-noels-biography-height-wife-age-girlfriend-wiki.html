This is one of the reasons why there are rumors circulating the internet claiming that Y’lan is gay; what contributed to the spread of these rumors <a rel=nofollow href=#>was a picture</a> featuring Y’lan and several shirtless male cast members of “Insecure”. Y’lan and the men (Jay Ellis, Wade Allain-Marcus and two others) were criticized on the internet by what appears to be a group of homophobic men, however, the actors defended themselves claiming nothing is wrong with men being shirtless in pictures, nor with being gay, but also stated that they were all straight.</p><p>Y’lan hasn’t commented on this matter, so some people still believe he’s gay.
